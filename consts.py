Sometimes up to 15," she says, placing a large black bindi, or dot used by Hindu women, between her perfectly shaped eyebrows.She sits in her tiny room with a bed, a cooking stove and posters of Bollywood stars taped across the wall.Hashi is one of around 900 sex workers - some as young as 12 - living a painful life of exploitation in Kandapara, not only bonded by debt and fear of stigma, but compelled to take the steroid, Oradexon, which brings more income but leaves dangerous side effects.COW FATTENING DRUGAlso known as Dexamethasone, Oradexon treats inflammation and allergies in humans and is used by farmers to fatten livestock.Charities say the over-the-counter d',

     'content': 'REFILE-Army chief says old weapons make India weak (Refiles to fix typo in second paragraph; sends to more subscribers) NEW DELHI, March 28 (Reuters) - Obsolete air defence and a severe shortage of ammunition weaken India\'s defence capabilities, the head of the army told the prime minister in a letter leaked on Wednesday, plunging the army\'s relations with the government to new lows. In the letter dated March 12, excerpts of which were printed by the DNA newspaper, Army Chief Vijay Kumar Singh said the tank fleet of the world\'s second-largest standing army was devoid of ammunition, elite special forces were "woefully short" of essential weapons and air defence was 97 percent obsolete. "The state of the major (fighting) arms i.e., Mechanised Forces, Artillery, Air Defence, Infantry and Special Forces, as well as the Engineers and Signals, is indeed alarming," Singh wrote in the letter. Sandwiched between fellow nuclear powers China and Pakistan, India is the world\'s top weapons importer. It is spending billions of dollars updating equipment purchased from Moscow in Soviet times, but it often takes decades to finalise contracts. Procurement has been slowed by corruption scandals. Defence Minister A.K. Antony confirmed the existence of the letter and said it should not have been made public. Politicians from all parties reacted angrily and some called for the army chief\'s resignation if he was found to be behind the leak. "The government is determined to do all that is needed to continue to assure the safety and security of India," Antony told parliament. "Publishing secret documents will not help the nation." In a rare show of unity, opposition parties rallied around the government, a sign of concerns about the army chief\'s habit of challenging his civilian masters. Earlier in the year Singh took the defence ministry to the Supreme Court after claiming he was a year younger than military records showed. He lost the case. On Monday, he said he had been offered a $2.8 m',

     'content': 'By Fabio Couto RIO DE JANEIRO\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0|\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Thu Jan 26, 2012 9:17am EST (Reuters) - Two buildings collapsed in downtown Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday, in the latest incident highlighting the failure of authorities to improve the city\'s infrastructure amid preparations to host soccer\'s World Cup and the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Olympics. Rescue crews pulled four people alive from the debris, with no dead bodies found by midnight, City Mayor Eduardo Paes told reporters at the site. Newswire Agencia Estado reported at least two fatalities in the collapse of both buildings, reportedly 20 and 10 story high. A loud explosion preceded the collapse, which left the surrounding area covered in debris and dust, witnesses said. "It was like an earthquake. First some pieces of the buildings started to fall down. People started to run. And then it all fell down at once," a witness who identified himself as Gilbert told Reuters. As many as 11 people could be trapped in the wreckage, cable broadcaster Globo News said. City authorities are assessing the risk of collapse of a damaged adjoining building, local newswires reported, without giving the source of the information. "I ran down the stairs desperate to escape. Just when I left the building it collapsed. I escaped by the skin of my teeth - it\'s the work of God," Nelson Tomes, 38, an air conditioning technician, told iG newswire. Tomes, who was on the 10th floor of one of the buildings, said he rushed to the stairwell after he heard a "huge noise." TV images showed cars covered with concrete and steel rods. Light, the electricity distribution company serving the city, cut power to the area to avert the possibility of fires after a strong smell of gas was detected, the TV broadcasters said. Rio de Janeiro is struggling to address concerns over poor infrastructure as it prepares to co-host the soccer World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games two years later. The incident comes months after an explosion apparently caused by a gas leak ripped through a restaurant in downto',

     'content': 'MEXICO CITY\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0|\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Mon Feb 20, 2012 4:04am EST (Reuters) - At least 44 people died in a fight between rival gangs at an overcrowded prison in northern Mexico in a violent outbreak that authorities said could have been a distraction that allowed some inmates to escape. Victims were beaten, stabbed and stoned when the fight broke out on Sunday. Inmates at the prison in Monterrey, about 140 miles from the border with Texas, include members of Mexico\'s Gulf cartel as well as the feared Zetas cartel. "We can\'t rule out the possibility that some prisoners escaped, which also could be a motive if the fight started as a distraction," said Jorge Domene, security spokesman for the Nuevo Leon state government. "When we count the prisoners, and the number of confirmed dead, there are some missing," he said. Investigators said corrupt prison guards may have been involved in facilitating the disturbance at the prison and authorities were holding all the prison officials for questioning, Domene told a news conference late on Sunday. In recent years there have been a number of prison breaks in Mexico, sometimes with the aid of complicit guards. Sunday\'s violence was the second deadly incident at a Latin American prison within a week. Desperate overcrowding in Honduras\' prisons last week led to a massive fire in a run-down jail that killed more than 350 inmates. The prison in Monterrey is, like many in Mexico, overcrowded as a result of the five-year-old drug war President Felipe Calderon has been waging against cartels. It was not clear if the fight was between members of the Gulf and Zetas cartels, Domene said. "We hope that once the bodies are identified, we\'ll be able to say who was responsible for the attack," he said earlier in the day. The prison held about 80 percent more prisoners than it was designed for, Domene said, adding many of the inmates were charged with federal crimes related to drug trafficking. In Mexico, where prisoners held on federal drug charges are mixed with co',

"This has been done under the directions of the Ministry of Information Technology. It\'s because of blasphemous content," said Mohammed Yaseen, chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). "They (the ministry) have been discussing with them (Twitter) for some time now, requesting them to remove some particular content," he said. Pakistan blocked access to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and about 1,000 other websites for nearly two weeks in May 2010 over blasphemous content. Any representation of the Prophet Mohammad is deemed un-Islamic and blasphemous by many Muslims, who constitute the overwhelming majority in Pakistan. PTA chairman Yaseen did not specify which users or messages had prompted the ban. The Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan said its members have been asked to block Twitter indefinitely, but no reason has been provided by the government. Yaseen said the ban would be lifted after ongoing discussions between the Pakistan government and Twitter about the allegedly blasphemous material are resolved. Officials from the Ministry of Information Technology and from Twitter were not immediately available for comment. Twitter has become increasingly popular in Pakistan in recent years, its users including politicians and government officials. (Reporting by Qasim Nauman; Editing by Daniel Magnowski)',

Congo\'s government confirmed the incident, but gave a lower toll and said it may have been caused by low water levels on the river due to the dry season. The accident took place mid-week on a stretch of the Congo River in the western Bandundu province, east of Kinshasa, the capital of the vast central African nation. "The boat was badly overloaded and it didn\'t make the rough waters," Jolly Limengo, provincial inspector of police for Bandundu, told Reuters by telephone on Thursday. "People here don\'t know how to swim. Our provisional toll is 138 dead," Limengo added. Naval forces and local Red Cross have gone to assist and collect the bodies, Information Minister Lambert Mende said. Mende told Reuters that the transport ministry\'s death toll currently stood at 80 and he said the accident took place on Tuesday at Mangutuka river post, about 120 km from Kinshasa. Limengo said earlier that it took place on Wednesday, 300 km from Kinshasa. No reason was given for the differences. "These accidents regularly take place in the dry season," Mende said, explaining that boats get snagged or can overturn on submerged sandbanks more easily as water levels fall. "Sometimes the boats are negligent and there\'s not enough water so they easily turn over," he said. Mende said rules obliging boat owners to take out insurance, and insurers to check the boats are in good condition before offering insurance are regularly ignored. "People regularly don\'t respect the rules," he said. The most recent previous accident took place just a week ago, also in Bandundu province, although no one was killed, he said. Decades of conflict and neglect have left the nation\'s infrastructure in tatters, meaning travel by air and river are often the best or only option for Congolese travellers. Accidents are',

With few police in evidence, demonstrators gathered at a statue of revered poet Alexander Pushkin and walked down Moscow\'s Boulevard Ring to the site of an Occupy-style, 24-hour protest two km (1.25 miles) away. Police took no action. "We are all here because we want justice in the country, we want an honest transition of power, we don\'t want a throne succession," said Nina, 45, a foreign language teacher who gave only her first name. President from 2000-2008 and prime minister until his inauguration to a six-year Kremlin term on May 7, Putin has angered Russians who want change and fear the continuation of his rule will bring stagnation and repression. Some 10,000 people turned out for the "test stroll", some wearing white ribbons reading "Russia without Putin". It took place a week after police clashed with demonstrators on the eve of Putin\'s May 7 inauguration, beating some on the head with batons in the worst violence since a series of protests started in December. Riot police detained more than 400 people at the May 6 protest and hundreds more on inauguration day, when they cleared streets near the path of Putin\'s convoy of peaceful protesters and bystanders, and grabbed people sitting at a sidewalk cafe. Two opposition leaders detained last week, Alexei Navalny and Sergei Udaltsov, are serving 15-day jail terms. Following the crackdown, Boris Akunin, a popular detective novelist who has become a Kremlin critic, called for the event on Sunday to test whether Muscovites would be allowed to peacefully walk in their city.

The Egyptian Football Association (EFA) banned the club, al-Masry, for two seasons on Friday for a pitch invasion that killed 74 fans last month, the most deadly incident since the protests that toppled President Hosni Mubarak last year. The EFA ordered Port Said Stadium, where the stampede took place after al-Masry beat Cairo\'s Al Ahli, to be closed for three years. Military police fired shots in the air to disperse hundreds of soccer fans protesting outside the Suez Canal Authority building in Port Said late on Friday, witnesses said. "Hundreds of angry fans clashed with military police after the decision was announced," one witness said. "One was shot dead, in the back, and 18 were injured in the clashes, two of them are suffering gunshot wounds," the medical source said. Clashes erupted again on Saturday after the funeral of the person who was shot. Protesters smashed the front of police and army clubs in the city and marched towards the canal authority\'s building. Police fired teargas and shot into the air. "I haven\'t seen a worse day than what Port Said is going through today," said Hany Abu Taleb, 28, a student in Port Said. "I demand the suspension of the decision (to ban the club) or its amendment ... We refuse to have the football league without Port Said." Port Said harbor was closed on Saturday morning because of the protests and ships using the Suez Canal were directed to a secondary route east of the city, sources at the Suez Canal Authority and Port Said harbor said. Shops were closed and many city residents stayed in their homes. Army and police stepped up security outside government buildings.

There are a few police vehicles left, and some spectators are still around observing."Last June, thousands of migrant workers, also largely from Sichuan, rioted and clashed with police in the Guangdong city of Zengcheng, torching cars and ransacking government buildings, over the rough treatment of a pregnant street hawker.Guangdong\'s ambitious party secretary Wang Yang, who will likely be elevated to China\'s elite politburo standing committee in a leadership transition this year, has acknowledged a need to mitigate simmering social unrest by stressing a more equitable and balanced "Happy Guangdong" mode of development.The number of "mass incidents", as such outbreaks of unrest are known, recorded by the government grew from 8,700 in 1993 to about',

They join 86 others already being tried for their links to a shadowy right-wing group accused of plotting a campaign of bombings and assassinations, in order to force the army to step in against Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan\'s government. The plot by the "Ergenekon" group is one of several factors that has strained relations between the government, which has its roots in political Islam, and the armed forces, who see themselves as guardians of Turkey\'s secular principles. The two-year-old case, in which almost 200 people including retired and active army officers, lawyers and journalists have been charged, has hurt financial markets and divided public opinion in predominantly Muslim but officially secular Turkey. Supporters say the case is a watershed moment in the waning influence of NATO member Turkey\'s powerful military, which has a long history of interfering in politics. Critics say the AK Party, which ended the secularists\' decades-long grip on power in 2002, is cajoling the judiciary to punish opponents in its attempt to take over state institutions. Among the 56 people who went on trial on Monday at Silivri prison near Istanbul are two four-star generals -- the highest-ranking officers charged in Turkey\'s modern history. They are retired general Sener Eruygur, a former commander of the paramilitary gendarmerie forces, and retired general Hursit Tolon, a former army commander. Both are charged with masterminding a terrorist group and inciting armed rebellion against the government. Prosecutors are seeking life imprisonment for the two.

"A Separation" was regarded as the front-runner for the foreign language Oscar after sweeping the awards circuit in Europe and the United States. It also garnered an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay but failed to win in that category on Sunday. It was the second Iranian film to be nominated for an Oscar, and the first to win. "At this time, many Iranians all over the world are watching us and I imagine them to be very happy," director Farhadi said while accepting the Oscar. "At a time of talk of war, intimidation and aggression is exchanged between politicians, the name of their county, Iran, is spoken here through her glorious culture, a rich and ancient culture that has been hidden under the heavy dust of politics." "I proudly offer this award to the people of my country, the people who respect all cultures and civilizations and despise hostility and resentment," he added. "A Separation" has received almost universal critical acclaim, gracing many top 10 lists for the best movies of 2011. Made for $800,000, the film has generated more than $13 million in worldwide box office sales, according to the web site Box Office Mojo, including $2.6 million in the U.S. Farhadi, who works and lives in Iran, has been reluctant to entertain theories that his film is a parable for the struggles between Iran\'s young dissidents and its paternalistic mullahs, saying it is up to audiences to take from the movie what they will. Others have interpreted "A Separation" as a comment on class differences, or as a critique of Iran\'s justice system, or a clash between modernity and tradition. Farhadi made t',

Two bombs were found and safely disarmed near the massacre site in Ampatuan town, in the southern largely Muslim province of Maguindanao, said provincial police chief Marcelo Pintac, adding that no one was hurt and the blast caused minor damage. The bomb was aimed at scaring people away from the commemoration of the 2009 ambush on an election-campaign convoy, he said. "It was meant to disrupt the activity," Pintac said of the blast. The other two devices, one made out of an artillery shell and the other from a mortar bomb, were left where they would be easily found, he said. Among those who attended the ceremony was provincial governor Esmael Mangudadatu, who lost his wife and several relatives in the attack. Thirty-three media people were also killed. The convoy was traveling on a mountain road to witness Mangudadatu\'s wife filing her husband\'s papers for a May 2010 election when gunmen struck. Victims were taken down a dirt road and shot and buried in mass graves. Some were buried in their vehicles. Mangudadatu was standing against a powerful political clan run by the Ampatuan family. The government has filed murder charges against 196 people, including former provincial governor Andal Ampatuan and his four sons. About 80 people have been arrested but only 64 are on trial, including the primary suspect who is one of the sons, Andal "Unsay" Ampatuan. The U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, Harry Thomas, said people around the world were closely watching the legal proceedings into the "appalling act of violence." "The prosecution of this case is seen ... as demonstrative of the Philippines\' commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting human rights," Thomas said in a statement.

Part performance art, part sculpture, Ataman\'s "Silsel" consists of hundreds of pieces of cloth inscribed with messages written by visitors, then stitched together to form a giant patchwork draped over a scaffold of wires. "Silsel" opened this month as a parliamentary commission writes articles of a new constitution to replace the current authoritarian charter drawn up after a 1980 military coup. The commission, made up of parliament\'s four main parties, invited citizens from all walks of life to provide input on the new charter. Representatives of Turkey\'s widely differing religions, ethnic groups, unions, sexual orientations and others participated. "When the government announced it would ask every segment of society to contribute to the new constitution, it occurred to me \'Silsel\' could be done as a civil demonstration of the process," Ataman, 51, said in an interview. "We\'re not used to a civil tone in our politics," he said. "This may be the first time in\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Turkey\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0that a political act has been turned into public art." Turner Prize-nominated Ataman, who also makes films, is one of Turkey\'s most politically outspoken artists. "Silsel" took shape when he was travelling across southeastern Turkey to neighbouring\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Syria\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0in 2011 to film the seeds of the uprising that has now claimed almost 10,000 lives. His crew and driver refused to continue to Syria after hearing reports of the violence while in the Turkish town of Mardin. As a diversion, Ataman was taken to the home of a local textile printmaker, Nasra Simmeshindi, 87. On her ceiling was a blue zigzag motif she called silsel, which Ataman later learned is Aramaic for "sky" or "fluttering of wings." Simmeshindi, a Syriac Christian, told him silsel stood in for the',

However, there seems to be no immediate threat to the stability of the government since the ruling Pakistan People\'s Party (PPP) has a comfortable majority in parliament. But the move is bound to sharply raise tensions between the unpopular civilian government and Supreme Court Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, who has made a name for himself in recent years by taking on Pakistan\'s most powerful figures. In April, the Supreme Court found Gilani guilty of contempt of court for refusing to reopen corruption cases against President Asif Ali Zardari. "Yusuf Raza Gilani stands disqualified as a member of the Majlis-e-Shoora (parliament)," said Chaudhry in a packed courtroom. "He has also ceased to be the prime minister of Pakistan ... the office of the prime minister stands vacant." Fawad Chaudhry, a senior Gilani aide, said only parliament could dismiss the prime minister, a view shared by analysts. However, within hours of the Supreme Court decision, state television reported that the Election Commission of Pakistan had issued the official notification of Gilani\'s disqualification. The ruling can be challenged. While the decision is a big blow to the PPP, it is unlikely to lead to the fall of the unpopular government. The U.S. State Department described the court decision as an internal affair, but said it expected discussions with Pakistan aimed at repairing deeply strained ties would continue. The PPP and its coalition partners have the numbers in parliament to elect a new prime minister until the government\'s term ends early next year when a general election is due. "I don\'t see this as a major constitutional breakdown unless the PPP ignores this decision," said legal expert ',

Introduced nearly a century ago by a former pupil of Eton College, this peculiar form of handball pulls in the crowds in impoverished Nigeria. "An English schoolteacher may have brought the game here but Nigerians are the best now," said Usman Yusuf, a civil servant and local Eton fives favorite in the northern state of Katsina, where many people live on less than $2 a day. "We love it. Every day after school we come here and fight to get on the court," said Yusuf, standing in front of crowds of barefooted schoolchildren shouting instructions to players dashing around graffiti-covered courts. In England, the game is played mostly by former or current public schoolboys who wear custom-made, padded gloves to smash a hard ball around a three-sided walled court where it ricochets off ledges and steps reproduced in the mold of the original school ground. Nigerians forgo the expense of gloves and make do with a tennis ball but the court retains the obstacles and idiosyncrasies that make a simple game into a skilful sport. EMIR\'S COURT "It looks simple but it has subtle skills that take intelligence. This is why Nigerians are so good at it," Umar Kabir, the secretary to the Emir of Katsina state, told Reuters. "The Emir has a court in the palace and every evening he goes out to play. He still plays to win." While the popularity of Eton fives peaked in Britain in the 19th century, hundreds of people still attend competitive games in Nigeria and matches in the annual Sardauna Cup are followed by dinners, cultural dances and speeches.

The FGV consumer confidence index slumped 2.8 percent in June from May, its second straight monthly decline, with households expectations worsening for the economy over the next six months. Economists cut forecasts for 2012 growth for the seventh straight week in a central bank survey, adding evidence of growing pessimism about once-booming emerging countries. Economists now see 2.18 percent growth, which would be Brazil\'s weakest annual economic growth since 2009. Their forecasts for the expected rebound in 2013 were also cut to 4.20 percent from 4.25 percent seen in the previous week. FGV\'s consumer confidence index remained above its historical average as the current economic slowdown have not yet erased record-low unemployment. However, the second decline in a row took it off April\'s record high. "Brazil\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0avoided a sharper slump in the 2008\'s crisis because of its domestic demand. But now we see demand cooling off. The government may have to push harder to boost it," said Felipe Queiroz, an economist at Austin Ratings, in Sao Paulo. The world\'s No.6 economy grew a slower-than-expected 0.2 percent in the first quarter of this year from 2011\'s fourth quarter as businesses, faced with a decline in global demand and higher labor costs, cut back on expansion and investments.

There are millions like Majid, 65, in Bangladesh and in the future there could be many millions more if scientists\' predictions of rising seas and more intense droughts and storms come true. "Bangladesh is already facing consequences of a sea level rise, including salinity and unusual height of tidal water," said Mizanur Rahman, a research fellow with the London-based International Institute for Environmental Development. "In the future, millions of people will lose their land and houses. Their survival will be threatened," Rahman told Reuters. Experts say a third of Bangladesh\'s coastline could be flooded if the sea rises one meter in the next 50 years, creating an additional 20 million Bangladeshis displaced from their homes and farms. This is about the same as Australia\'s population. Saline water will creep deeper inland, fouling water supplies and crops and livestock will also suffer, experts say. Government officials and NGOs estimate about 10 million people are already threatened by annual floods and storms damaging riverine and coastal islands. It is unclear how the government could feed, house or find enough clean water for vast numbers of climate refugees in a country of 140 million people crammed into an area of 55,500 sq miles. "We are taking steps to face the threats of climate change. Bangladesh needs $4 billion to build embankments, cyclone shelters, roads and other infrastructure in the next 15 years to mitigate the threats," Mohammad Aminul Islam Bhuiyan, the top bureaucrat in the government\'s Economic Relations Division, told Reuters.

Many soccer supporters are convinced a post-match stampede that left 74 people dead in Port Said on February 1 was deliberately provoked by state security officials still loyal to ousted President Hosni Mubarak. Fans say the Interior Ministry caused the crush to punish visiting supporters of Cairo\'s Al Ahly club for their role in Mubarak\'s overthrow last year and subsequent protests demanding democracy and the reform of a widely despised police force. A parliamentary inquiry blamed fans and shoddy policing for the deaths and the head of state security in Port Said was fired along with the board of the Egyptian Football Association. The security forces are now refusing to oversee top-flight matches, forcing the sport\'s governing body to scrap the rest of the season. Many fans agree the cancellation was inevitable, but for some people it sends a message that lawlessness has won. "Match security is the easiest task for police if it\'s done with an efficient plan," said Foad Allam, a former police general and security expert. "If they can\'t secure a game, how can they secure a country?" The fans\' next move may depend on a court case brought over the events in Port Said which opens in Cairo this month. Seventy-five people including nine police officers are charged with crimes ranging from negligence to premeditated murder. Most of the deaths were of people trampled in the crush of a panicking crowd, while others fell or were thrown from terraces. A steel door to the stadium was shut, trapping terrified fans, and the arena\'s floodlights went out during the chaos, fanning suspicions of a conspiracy. Many spectators complained of a tiny police presence despite a tense build-up to the match. A small grou',

The attacks are the first on Eritrean soil that Ethiopia has admitted to since the end of a 1998-2000 war that killed 70,000 people and left a border dispute unresolved. Eritrea says there have been others. "We\'ve carried out further attacks on targets inside Eritrea. This time it\'s in the north section around Badme," a senior Ethiopian government official told Reuters on Saturday. "We were once again successful. This strike was part of our plan to take proportional measures that included the (earlier)attacks in Eritrea\'s southeast." He did not specify who had been targeted in the latest attack. On Thursday Ethiopia said it had raided three military bases inside Eritrea that it said were being using to train an Ethiopian rebel group it blames for killing five foreign tourists and kidnapping two others in its remote Afar region in January. Eritrea responded by saying it would not be "entrapped" by the military incursion, signalling its determination to avert another conflict with its bitter foe, and it called on the United Nations to act against the aggression. A spokesman for Ban Ki-moon said the U.N. chief urged both sides to exercise "maximum restraint" and "respect each other\'s territorial integrity." The British government expressed concern about the earlier incursion into Eritrea, saying it risked undermining efforts to develop security and stability across the Horn of Africa. A vicious row over the position of Eritrea and Ethiopia\'s shared border was not resolved at the end of the war. The Hague-based Eritrea-Ethiopia Bounda',

      'content': 'Diabetes continuing to spike in China By Kerry Grens NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The more common type of diabetes in China grew by 30 percent in just seven years, according to a new survey of thousands of Shanghai residents. The curse of affluence appears to be affecting China as it has many other developing countries. "There is a certainly a pattern that we\'re seeing over and over again," said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, the vice president for global health at Emory University. People with type 2 diabetes have trouble processing sugar in their blood, but do not generally require insulin to manage the condition. As countries become more wealthy, lifestyle factors associated with type 2 diabetes -- such as weight gain, less healthy diets and less physical activity -- tend to become more common. "Unlike the gradual transition in most Western countries, these changes in China have occurred over a very short time," the researchers, led by Dr. Rui Li at the Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, write in their study in the journal Diabetes Care. The research team interviewed more than 12,000 people in 2002 and 2003. They asked whether the participants had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and they screened people for diabetes who had not been diagnosed before. They found that 9.7 percent of people had diabetes. The researchers surveyed about 7,400 people again in 2009, and found that 12.6 percent of people had the disease. "That\'s a remarkable increase in seven years," Koplan told Reuters Health. The spike was even more dramatic among the rural residents in the study -- going from 6.1 percent to 9.8 percent, a 60 percent increase. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 8.3 percent of Americans have diabetes.

In December, two Swedish journalists were sentenced to 11 years in jail for entering the country illegally and aiding a rebel group, prompting anger among rights groups and concern over media freedom in the east African country. Woubishet Taye and Reyot Alemu were found guilty last week of conspiring to participate in terrorist acts and laundering money from rebel groups and Ethiopian arch-foe Eritrea. The pair had been arrested in July. "I didn\'t expect this sentencing, she didn\'t commit terrorist crimes," said Reyot\'s lawyer, Mola Zegeye, adding that the two will appeal the sentence. U.S.-based Elias Kifle, whose pro-opposition website www.EthiopianReview.com often criticises the government, was tried in absentia and sentenced to life on similar charges. Addis Ababa has been accused by watchdogs of clamping down on its media under the guise of national security, a charge the government denies. Critics point to an anti-terrorism law passed after several blasts in 2009 and stating that anyone caught publishing information that could induce readers into acts of terrorism could be jailed for between 10 to 20 years. More than 10 journalists have been charged under the law, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The group also says Ethiopia is close to replacing Eritrea as the African country with the highest number of journalists behind bars. The Ethiopian government denies targeting journalists because of their reporting or political affiliations. Woubshet and Reyot were found to have links to Ginbot 7, one of five groups the government has banned as terrorist organisations. Ethiopia accuse',

The U.S.-based Carter Center observer mission said the results issued by Congo\'s election commission "lack credibility" and pointed to uncounted ballots in opposition strongholds and "impossibly high" turnout in places where Kabila is favored. Shooting rang out in some cities, including the capital Kinshasa, after Kabila\'s main challenger, Etienne Tshisekedi, said he rejected the official results and declared himself the new leader of the vast central African state. Tresor Nkuna, a resident of Kinshasa, an urban sprawl of 10 million people, said: "We haven\'t been able to sleep because of the gunfire. We don\'t know when it\'ll stop, it\'s very violent." Many other parts of Kinshasa were quiet with people staying indoors, witnesses said, but clashes between protesters and security forces were reported elsewhere in the country, with the United Nations reporting at least one dead. Protests also erupted in former colonial power Belgium.

But the poll was marked by violence, chaotic preparations and allegations of fraud. Concerns are mounting of a prolonged and violent dispute over the outcome, and diplomatic sources have said international mediation efforts may be needed to avert a crisis. Congo\'s election commission announced on Friday that Kabila took nearly 49 percent of the votes to Tshisekedi\'s roughly 32 percent, winning Kabila a new mandate. The results must now be ratified by the Supreme Court. Tshisekedi called the results "a provocation" and said he considered him',

Yudhoyono\'s popularity at home has fallen this year because of slow policy making and a stalled fight against corruption.

Foreign investors have taken the stock market to record highs and their bond ownership to record levels, with only a limited sell-off recently on increased global risk aversion following the U.S. sovereign rating downgrade.

The bus slammed into Serepok River on Thursday night while passing a bridge between Daklak and Dak Nong provinces, crushing many to death, the news website VNExpress (vnexpress.net) quoted Daklak\'s Deputy Chairman Dinh Van Khiet as saying. "The front head of the bus was submerged and deformed, making it hard for the rescue work," Khiet was quoted as saying. He said 34 people were killed and 25 or 26 others injured. The website showed photographs of people pulling wreckage of the bus from the river and police placing bodies on a mattress. Daklak is 350 km (220 miles) northeast of Ho Chi Minh City.

Reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) rose to $11.97 billion from $11.86 billion a week earlier, while those held by commercial banks fell to $4.63 billion from $4.66 billion. "The increase in (the SBP\'s) reserves is due to small multilateral and other inflows," said Syed Wasimuddin, chief spokesman of the central bank. Foreign exchange reserves hit a record $18.31 billion in July last year, boosted by inflows of $411 million, including a $191.9 million loan from the World Bank and a $196.8 million loan from the Asian Development Bank. Higher exports and record remittances have also supported Pakistan\'s reserves. Remittances from Pakistanis overseas rose 21.45 percent to $9.73 billion in the first nine months of the 2011/12 fiscal year, compared with $8.02 billion in the same period last year. In March, remittances totaled $1.14 billion. Reserves have since been drained by debt repayments, including $399 million in the week ending Feb. 24 on an $8 billion International Monetary Fund loan. The next repayment is due by the end of the 2011/12 fiscal year. (Reporting by Sahar Ahmed; Editing by Ed Lane)',

On Sunday, a man died after his car, pursued by strikers, hit a roadside tree.Officials from the BNP, led by former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, said more than 100 of its supporters were injured and scores detained across the country.Ali went missing with his driver on Tuesday. Police recovered his abandoned car and mobile phone near his home.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\'s government has ordered a probe into the disappearance, but the BNP and Ali\'s family allege he was abducted by security forces. Police deny the charge.Activists called for the stoppage, in force from dawn to dusk, to resume on Monday."We are calling for another day-long strike on Monday and may go for further action if the government fails to find Ilyas Ali and produce him before the public immediately," BNP secretary-general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told reporters.State Minister for Home Affairs Shamsul Haque said authorities would deal firmly with violence.The BNP and its Islamist allies have demanded the resignation of Hasina and early elections, which are not due to take place before the end of 2013.Khaleda accuses Hasina of instituting "virtual one-party rule" to remain in office. The government dismisses opposition demands and says it will remain in office until the last day of its mandate.Hasina and Khaleda have dominated the nation\'s politics for two decades and analy',

Protesters, holding sticks and copies of the Koran, squatted on the highway and chanted demands for scrapping the policy on women.On Monday, authorities deployed hundreds of extra police in the capital, where clashes with strikers occurred in several places."We are keeping a strong vigil against attempts to disrupt economic activities and damage property," one police officer said.On Sunday, a student at an Islamic school about 280 kilometers (175 miles) west of Dhaka was shot dead during clashes between police and protesters rallying in support of Monday\'s strike.Police said the 22-year-old man was hit by a stray bullet and died while at least 25 people, including some police officers, were injured in the violence in Jessore.The IOJ opposes the government\'s policy to promote women\'s development, which was announced last year but not put into effect yet. The group says it will cause Muslim women to violate Sharia law as they seek equality with men in all respects, including education, jobs and the right to family property.The government says the policy does not violate Islam. "Anyone trying to mislead people in the name of religion and trying to create chaos will be dealt with under laws of the country," Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told a rally in southeastern Cox\'s Bazar on Sunday afternoon."We will not tolerate any attempt to destabilise the country or hurt the economy," she add',

It also wants to accelerate the development of renewable energy, as well as energy-saving technologies, such as electric and hybrid cars.China is the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2), followed by the United States.A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Thursday said China spurred a jump in global CO2 emissions to their highest ever recorded level in 2011, offsetting falls in the United States and Europe.However, its CO2 emissions per unit of GDP, or its carbon intensity, fell by 15 percent between 2005 and 2011, the IEA said, suggesting the world's second-largest economy was finding less carbon-consuming ways to fuel growth.Longer term, China is targeting cuts to its 2020 greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45 percent compared with 2003 levels and aims to boost its use of renewable energy to 15 percent of overall energy consumption.Negotiators from over 180 nations are meeting in Bonn, Germany, until Friday to work towards getting a new global climate pact signed by 2015.

      'content': 'By Mayank Bhardwaj NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Every day some 3,000 Indian children die from illnesses related to malnutrition, and yet countless heaps of rodent-infested wheat and rice are rotting in fields across the north of their own country. It is an extraordinary paradox created by a rigid regime of subsidies for grain farmers, a woeful lack of storage facilities and an inefficient, corruption-plagued public distribution system that fails millions of impoverished people. And it is an embarrassment for the government led by the Congress party, which returned to power in 2009 thanks in large part to pledges of welfare for the poor, who make up about 40 percent of the 1.2 billion population. Quite why the authorities could not simply offload the mountains of grain for free to fill empty stomachs is puzzling, but the explanation lies in the complex regulations that govern procurement and distribution. "This is a case of criminal neglect by the government," said D. Raja, national secretary of the Communist Party of India, an opposition group. "The ruling party has been the worst manager of the demand-supply of food grains." Officials say that, in all, about 6 million tons of grain worth at least $1.5 billion could perish. Analysts say the losses could be far higher because more than 19 million tons are now lying in the open, exposed to searing summer heat and monsoon rains. Saddomajra, a village in the bread-basket state of Punjab, is one of the dumping grounds for the record stockpile of wheat that has accumulated after half a decade of bumper harvests in the world\'s second-largest producer of the grain. Here there are thousands of sacks of decomposing wheat, occupying an area the size of a football field and towering in some places to the height of a house. Tarpaulins cover most of the mounds, but many of the bags are torn, spilling blackened grain blighted by fungus and insects. "The wheat has been lying there for the past five years. It smells very bad," said Hakkam ',

Luxury sales in the football-loving country are tiny compared with other emerging markets such as\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0China, Russia or the Middle East, but they are rising much faster than many expected. Many luxury groups long refrained from building a big business in the country, deterred by Brazil\'s high import duties, complex bureaucracy and lack of retail space. But in the course of the past few year years, Gucci, Chanel, Burberry, Christian Louboutin and other big names have opened shops in Brazil, lured by new luxury malls built by groups such as Iguatemi Empresa de Shopping Centers (IGTA3.SA) and the rising purchasing power of the country\'s middle class. The number of very high net worth individuals in Brazil has also risen exponentially. Billionaires in Brazil in 2010 totaled 30, up 60 percent against 2009, having benefited from higher commodity prices and a stronger currency, according to Forbes. Diane von Furstenberg\'s shop, opened two years ago in the Iguatemi center in Sao Paulo, ranks now No. 2 after her New York flagship store in terms of sales, the designer said this week. "I did not expect that," Furstenberg told the Reuters Luxury and Fashion Summit in Paris. "Brazilians love life ... Brazil is really an incredible market." Hermes (HRMS.PA) says trading is booming at its store in the upscale Cidade Jardim shopping mall in Sao Paulo. It opened two years ago after many unsuccessful attempts to lure partners. As a sign the country is now on the radar screen of the luxury world, the International Herald Tribune newspaper is hosting its annual luxury conference in Sao Paulo in November.

      'content': 'Child addicts at heart of Indonesia anti-smoking suit By Olivia Rondonuwu and Matthew Bigg KARAWANG GIRANG, Indonesia (Reuters) - Anti-tobacco advocates in Indonesia plan to file a class action lawsuit this month using cases of child addicts in the hope of forcing tougher regulations on a society where one in three people smokes. It is a rare attempt of its kind to constrain a tobacco industry which looks to the world\'s fourth most populous country and its growing appetite for cigarettes to replace dwindling sales elsewhere. The suit against tobacco companies and the Indonesian government argues that feeble regulation has left children dangerously exposed to the risks of smoking. "There are ... kids who have fallen victim to the impact of cigarette companies and smoking. They are addicted. In the context of people\'s rights, the society has been disadvantaged by the tobacco industry," head of the National Commission for Child Protection, Arist Merdeka Sirait, said. Indonesia is something of a paradise for both smokers and tobacco companies, with the world\'s fifth largest population of smokers. It is a widely tolerated habit and one which even in this relatively poor archipelago most can afford to feed. And it is getting more popular as the economy grows. In 1995, one in four Indonesians smoked. Fifteen years later it had risen to one in three. That in turn has tempted international tobacco firms to join the hugely profitable home-grown ones such as Gudang Garam, PT Djarum and Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna, which is now part of Philip Morris International. The government even gives tax incentives for the manufacture of hand-rolled cigarettes because it provides such a major source of employment in east Java where the local firms congregate. Sampoerna said it had only seen reports of the planned lawsuit and could not comment. Other producers also had no immediate comment. A spokesman for the Federation of Indonesian Cigarette Manufacturers said he had heard of the suit but',

The local stock market benchmark index rose 4.1 percent. In truth, there is some way to go before Thailand attains enough stability to regain favour with global investors \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a good start. Thailand doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t need a political about-turn. The deposed Democrat Party shepherded the Thai economy prudently. Even a bout of bloody violence between the red shirts, who back Thaksin, and the yellow shirts who favour the royal establishment and Democrats, failed to knock the country off its course towards 8 percent GDP growth in 2010. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s largely because both sides respected the importance of strong banks, moderate leverage and fiscal prudence, and ensured that a downturn did not turn into an economic crisis. A dependence on exports, equivalent to around three-quarters of GDP, has helped separate growth from politics too. But instability has brought a cost. Investors haven\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t piled into Thailand in the way they have neighbours like Indonesia and Malaysia. For Morgan Stanley, the country is its biggest \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93underweight\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d among emerging markets, partly because of an elevated sense of political risk. Around $1 billion of investment drained away in the month before the elections. Ongoing concerns that the victorious Puer Thai party might create discord by calling for an amnesty for Thaksin over corruption allegations \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d or vengeance on those who supressed red shirt protests in 2010 \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d could linger for months.

More commonly known as the Ogaden, the ethnic Somali province is home to a low-key insurgency led by the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), which has fought for independence since 1984. Government officials could not be reached for comment. "The Ethiopian army and its local conscripts killed more than 100 civilian people from May 10 - 15 in the area, (and it) is still on going," the ONLF said in a statement. "The (ONLF) intelligence service has ascertained that the Ethiopian army conducted the killing and abduction of U.N. local staff in the Ogaden jointly with the notorious militia of the (local) administration," it said. The United Nations\' World Food Programme (WFP) said on Saturday that one of its drivers had been killed in an ambush by unknown gunmen in an attack that left another staff member wounded. [ID:nLDE74D0CU] Two members of the convoy were also missing, WFP said. The ONLF said the incidents occurred while government troops conducted "kill-on-sight" operations in the Ogaden\'s Fafan valley and that the attack on the U.N. convoy was an attempt to "silence" its employees who had witnessed the operations. Authorities in Addis Ababa were not immediately available for comment, but they usually reject the group\'s claims as "baseless propaganda". The allegations are impossible to verify because journalists and aid groups cannot move unhindered in the area. This is not the first time the ONLF has accused government troops of atrocities in the region. The group said in January that soldiers had arbitrarily executed civilians and carried out ethnic cleansing in the province, a charge dis',

      'content': 'Mad cow disease found in California; no human threat seen By Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities reported the first U.S. case of mad cow disease in six years on Tuesday and quickly assured consumers and global importers that meat from the California dairy cow did not enter the food chain. John Clifford, the USDA\'s chief veterinary officer, said the case was "atypical" and that there was "no cause for alarm" from the animal. Cows can contract the disease spontaneously in rare cases and that it cannot be transmitted unless the brain or spinal tissue is consumed by humans or another animal, according to scientists. Mad cow, or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, is believed to cause the deadly brain disease variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob in humans who eat infected parts from animals with the disease. The first mad cow case in the United States was in late 2003 and caused the nation\'s beef exports to drop by nearly $3 billion the following year. There is no evidence that humans can catch it from drinking the milk of an infected cow. However, fears of a potential backlash among consumers and big importers of U.S. beef caused Chicago live cattle futures to drop sharply. The USDA has begun notifying authorities at the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as well as U.S. trading partners, but the finding should not affect the nation\'s beef exports, Clifford said. The USDA is still tracing the exact life of the infected animal. The carcass of the cow, which the USDA said was infected by an "atypical" form of the disease, is under quarantine and would be destroyed. The cow, which was found at a rendering plant that processes diseased or sick animals into non-edible products for use in things like soap or glue, was not believed to have contracted the disease by eating contaminated feed, the USDA said. "There is really no concern for alarm here with regards to this animal. Both human health and animal health are protected with regards to this issue," Clifford',

But when soldiers stormed a nondescript warehouse in April, they found that a drug cartel had moved into Chalco to churn out tons of their latest hot product, methamphetamine. Behind a sign saying it stocked cleaning goods, a row of huge cauldrons covered in domed glass cooked up barrel-loads of the synthetic white powder, known as crystal meth or ice. The warehouse was one of a record number of super-labs that Mexican authorities have busted in recent months, showing that despite President Felipe Caldron\'s five-year offensive against drug cartels, Mexican meth production is booming. The burgeoning industry is a major concern to police as it gives cartels a highly profitable product that can be made using legal ingredients in any town, spreading Mexico\'s brutal drug war to areas that had previously been free of violence. It has also set off alarm bells in the United States, where agents who have spent years battling the effects of the destructive drug fear there may be a sudden surge in supply. In the first quarter of 2012, Mexican soldiers raided 27 industrial meth labs like that in Chalco, twice the number they stormed in the same period of 2011 and their biggest ever total in any three-month period, the attorney general\'s office said. Their most spectacular meth seizure was in a ranch outside the western city of Guadalajara in February, when they nabbed 15 tons of processed crystal, one of the largest hauls of the drug ever made worldwide. If sold in small doses to U.S. users, known as "tweekers," that meth would have been worth about $1.2 billion.

      'content': 'By Meghana Keshavan DETROIT (Reuters) - Seven members of a Midwestern militia group accused of plotting to kill police were preparing for war against the United States government, prosecutors told jurors on Monday at the start of a federal trial in Detroit. Defense attorneys responded that the six men and one woman were part of a social club called the Hutaree who sought to defend themselves and did not view the government as an enemy. The trial is the latest example of the U.S. government prosecuting what it views as a growing threat of violence from home-grown zealots opposed to the government -- the most dramatic case of which was the 1995 bombing of an Oklahoma City government building that killed 168 people. Until the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington carried out by Al-Qaeda, the Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest act of terror on U.S. soil, and the key instigator, Timothy McVeigh, was executed in 2001. Prosecutors at the Hutaree trial laid out an array of weapons including assault rifles, military style helmets and bullet-resistant vests seized in the investigation and played video and audio recordings for jurors in their opening statement. "David Stone Sr. wanted a war," Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Graveline said of the group\'s leader, who is on trial with three members of his family and three others. In one video excerpt shown to jurors, Stone Sr. could be seen saying, "This war will come whether we are ready or not" and "We have to strike and take our nation back from tyranny." The group opposes government regulation of firearms and explosives. The seven defendants are accused of conspiring to kill a police officer and then ambush a funeral procession using homemade explosive devices to spark a wider war against the U.S. government. "The Hutaree believed there was a brotherhood of local, state and federal officers that was secretly run by global elitists who wanted to start a new world order," Graveline said. Defense attorne',

The GWS think tank said it expected the number of jobs linked to the renewables industry to rise to as much as 600,000 in 2030. Currently around 382,000 jobs are linked to the industry, equivalent to about 1 percent of the workforce in Europe's biggest economy, The study included employees involved in making and maintaining renewable energy equipment as well as workers indirectly serving the sector such as scientists, suppliers and service industries. Chancellor Angela Merkel is banking on a major expansion in renewables to make up for possible power shortfalls from an accelerated exit from the nuclear industry - a move she abruptly announced a year ago after Japan's Fukushima disaster. Germany aims to derive 35 percent of its power from renewable sources in 2020 and 80 percent in 2050 from 20 percent now although critics say those targets looks a long way off. German industry, which prides itself on adapting to new global trends, has shifted some of its traditional heavy engineering to green technology in the last decade. This has helped to shield its economy and job market from the worst of the financial and debt crises. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 The solar sector, boosted in the last decade by generous incentives which turned Germany into the world's largest market for solar panels, accounts for around a third of jobs in the renewables sector. Some experts are pessimistic about the solar sector due to cuts in incentives and increased competition from abroad - several firms in the branch have gone bankrupt in the last year. But the GWS study said the industry should hold its own. Bioenergy also accounts for about a third of jobs in the renewables branch with wind energy contributing over a quarter of jobs. Offshore ",

The hacker, who uses the name Hardcore Charlie and said he was a friend of Hector Xavier Monsegur, the leader-turned- informant of the activist hacking group, LulzSec, told Reuters he got inside Beijing-based China National Import & Export Corp (CEIEC). He posted documents ranging from purported U.S. military transport information to internal reports about business matters on several file-sharing sites, but the authenticity of the documents could not be independently confirmed. The Beijing company, better known by the acronym, CEIEC, did not respond to a request for comment. U.S. intelligence and Department of Defense officials had no immediate comment. CEIEC's website says the company performs systems integration work for the Chinese military. Cyber-spying, both economic and political, is a growing concern for companies and governments around the world. The Chinese government is often accused of promoting, or at least tolerating, hacking attacks aimed at Western targets. But Chinese institutions have rarely been publicly identified as victims of such attacks. Hackers associated with LulzSec have largely targeted Western defense contractors and law enforcement, although some of their attacks may have been driven by FBI informants. LulzSec is a spin-off of Anonymous, an amorphous collective that uses computer break-ins to promote social causes and expose what members see as wrongdoing by governments and corporations. Hardcore Charlie said in email and Twitter conversations with Reuters that he had worked with others to crack the email passwords that got him inside CEIEC.

Ethiopia, which has seen high economic growth over the past five years, hopes to exploit growing business ties with\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0China, India and Turkey to boost its expanding economy. Under a five-year development plan launched in 2010, the government aims to pursue power projects and boost infrastructure, including building several new railways. Getachew Betru, head of the Ethiopian Railways Corporation (ERC), said Turkish firm Yapi Merkezi will build a $1.7 billion railway line in the northeast, part of a project that stretches to Djibouti's third port of Tadjourah, which is under construction. Tadjourah, on the Red Sea, is the closest outlet for Ethiopia's Afar region, where a number of foreign firms, including Canada's Allana Potash Corp, a re developing potash mines. Allana said in February it would work with Djibouti authorities to integrate required potash storage and handling facilities into the new port plans. Wednesday's deal followed a $1.5 billion agreement signed over the weekend between ERC and China Communications Construction Company to build a different section of the railway line to Tadjourah port. Yapi Merkazi is expected to complete its portion of the line in 42 months, the foreign ministry said on its website. This will link up with the section being built by the Chinese firm, as well as other portions, to give Ethiopia an alternative port access from the current route to Djibouti's mai n outlet, and providing an outlet for potash development, Ethiopia aims to construct 5,000 km of railway lines by 2020 and says companies from BRIC nations have shown an interest in several projects.

Since that national humiliation, nearly 200 million people have climbed out of extreme poverty and India\'s share of global output has more than doubled. Per capita GDP, measured in dollars at purchasing power parity, has risen more than five-fold. The architect of India\'s renaissance is the current prime minister, Manmohan Singh, who took over as finance minister in June 1991 and lit the blue touch paper for growth by dismantling the "Licence Raj" that had India tied up in red tape. As prime minister, Singh has disappointed reformers. He has failed to overcome opposition to market opening in sectors such as retailing and financial services; infrastructure, the sinews of any economy, is woeful; and a long-awaited national goods and service tax has still not been launched. Given these shortcomings and Delhi\'s perennial struggle to cap inflation and the budget deficit, it speaks volumes for the underlying vibrancy of the economy that many forecasters remain confident about India\'s chances in coming years. "I am very very hopeful of the next five to seven years. I think we can sustain this growth," said S. Narayan, who was economic adviser to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The International Monetary Fund says India has the potential to grow between 8 percent and 8.5 percent a year over the medium term. Economists at Citi are even more bullish: they project 8.8 percent annual gross domestic product growth between 2010 and 2015, shading the rate of 8.7 percent pencilled in for China.

On Thursday, before a three-day weekend and the Sunday poll, the main SET index closed up 0.8 percent at 1,041.48. In the run-up to the poll, the market pulled back from a 15-year high set in late April because investors were worried a hung parliament would lead to a protracted period of horsetrading for coalition seats or even unrest in the street. The market suffered $1.44 billion of foreign outflows from the start of May against inflows for other Southeast Asian bourses during the period, notably to Indonesia and the Philippines, according to Thomson Reuters data. Foreign inflows would now resume, said Parin Kitchatornpitak, senior analyst at broker Far East Securities. "The stock market could rise by 2-3 percent. This is a majority vote (for Puea Thai) and there should be no objections. For foreign inflows, it should be positive."

The boy, identified only by his surname Wang, now suffers from renal deficiency, Xinhua quoted prosecutors in Chenzhou city, Hunan province as saying.According to the Xinhua account, one of the defendants received about 220,000 yuan (about $35,000) to arrange the transplant. He paid Wang 22,000 yuan and split the rest with the surgeon, the three other defendants and other medical staff.The report did not say who received and paid for the kidney.The teen was from Anhui, one of China\'s poorest provinces, where inhabitants frequently leave to find work and a better life elsewhere. He bought an iPhone and iPad, and when asked by his mother where he got the money, admitted selling a kidney.Apple products are hugely popular in China, but are priced beyond the reach of many Chinese. IPhones start at 3,988 yuan ($633), and iPads begin at 2,988 yuan ($474).Wang\'s renal deficiency is deteriorating, Xinhua quoted prosecutors as saying.Only a fraction of the people who need organ transplants in China are able to get them, leading to "transplant tourism" where patients travel overseas for such operations, and to a black market for human organs.China banned the trading of human organs in 2007, Xinhua said. Several other suspects involved in the case are still being investigated.(Reporting by Terril Yue Jones; Editing by Peter Graff)',

The blackout on Tuesday night left tens of millions of people without power across most of the country\'s wealthy southeastern region, halting subways and snarling traffic in major cities like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva summoned his energy minister, Edison Lobao, for an urgent meeting in Brasilia on Wednesday to explain what triggered the outage. Energy officials said it was likely caused when a storm downed three transmission lines carrying power from the giant Itaipu hydroelectric dam on Brazil\'s border with Paraguay. "We didn\'t have a failure in the generation of energy, we had a problem in the transmission line," Lula told reporters in Brasilia, the capital. Responding to criticism that the government has neglected to maintain and upgrade Brazil\'s energy infrastructure, Lula said investment in transmission lines over the last seven years amounted to 30 percent of what had been spent over the preceding 120 years. Brazil\'s economy has forged ahead in recent years under former union leader Lula and was quick to shrug off the global financial crisis. But transport and energy infrastructure remain weak points for Latin America\'s largest country, which will host the 2014 World Cup and the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Olympics\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0two years later.

"Iran, helped by its customers, is trying to obfuscate as much as possible," said a senior executive at a national oil company that has done business with Iran. And Iran may have countered a reported reduction in its oil sales in March by offering big discounts in the form of free freight, finance and insurance and generous credit terms, the sources said. Europe\'s July 1 oil embargo, and U.S. and European financial sanctions against Iran\'s nuclear program have seen Tehran\'s oil sales drop to most Western destinations and drawn promises from some Asian buyers that they will cut purchases. But cheap, covert sales may have curbed or even reversed the reduction in shipments, the sources say. Discretion is paramount. Ship captains steering NITC supertankers have switched off recognition systems and customers are keeping business strictly under wraps. "People are being very secretive right now.

"We need to ... reduce the use of fossil fuels and this is the way, projects that generate electricity without burning anything, without burning gas, without burning oil," Calderon said at an event with governors and company representatives. Mexico, a top oil exporter to the United States, has seen oil output fall in recent years as production declines at its largest, aging fields. The country now produces around 2.6 million barrels of oil per day, down from a peak in 2004 of 3.4 million bpd and has to import 40 percent of its gasoline needs due to a lack of in-country refining capacity. Calderon wants to expand the use of wind, hydro, solar and other green energy sources to reach 26 percent of national demand by 2012, up slightly from the 23 percent used in Mexico when he took office in 2006. With Canon Power Group\'s investment, Calderon said Mexico would reach $100 billion in foreign investment by the end of his administration, with companies continuing to pour money into the U.S. neighbor despite problems like rising drug violence.

Christopher Guarin, 41, a radio talk show host and newspaper publisher in General Santos City, was shot six times in the head and body while driving home with his wife and nine-year-old daughter, according to a statement by Rowena Paraan, executive coordinator of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP). His wife was also wounded in the attack and his daughter was in a state of shock after witnessing the murder of her father, said Freddie Solinap, manager of "Tatak", a community newspaper where Guarin worked as editor. "I suspect this has something to do with his business as newspaper publisher and editor," Solinap told reporters, adding that Guarin had been getting death threats on his mobile phone. "He even read the threatening messages in his radio programme." About 150 journalists had been killed in the Philippines since 1986, the NUJP said. Nine had been killed since President Benigno Aquino assumed office in mid-2010. That tally includes at least 33 journalists in a massacre of 57 people in the southern Philippines in 2009, which the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says is the world\'s single deadliest event for journalists.

The four were part of a group of 27 tourists attacked on Tuesday in the remote region of Afar in Ethiopia. Two Germans, two Hungarians and an Austrian were killed in the ambush. "We can ... confirm that those German nationals who were taken together with the Ethiopian soldiers are safe and in good health," the rebel Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front (ARDUF) said in a statement dated Jan. 21. "We can ensure that their peaceful release will be granted through peaceful negotiation ... through the Afar elders in the region." The group did not disclose where it was holding the four and gave no indication of a ransom or any other conditions for the hostages\' release. ARDUF says it is fighting for the unification of areas occupied by the Afars, whose sun-blasted homeland straddles Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti. The rebel movement was previously blamed for the kidnapping of five Westerners in 2007. Addis Ababa has accused neighbouring Eritrea of staging Tuesday\'s attack, and said it believed the four were being held there. Asmara has dismissed the charge. An Ethiopian government official said the attack was carried out by an armed group of between 30 and 40 men. ARDUF also denied an Eritrean role in the attack and said Ethiopian troops had killed the tourists during a battle. "Our forces killed 16 Ethiopian soldiers and wounded a dozen of them ... when the Ethiopian forces opened fire on our patrolling unit," it said. Government officials were not immediately available for comment. Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a 1998-2000 border war that killed 70,000 people, and the dispute still festers. Foreigners who venture out into the area usually include researchers, aid',

The country recorded 32,588 cases of the disease this year, and the deaths happened in 17 provinces and municipalities, mostly in the southern region, a statement on the government\'s website said late Thursday. Hand, foot and mouth disease is relatively common among children, characterized by a fever, sores in the mouth and blistery rashes. There is no vaccine or cure, but patients usually recover in a week without treatment. In severe cases, brain swelling can lead to paralysis or death. The disease was a "large danger to the health and lives of young children," Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said in a statement. Yet attempts to prevent it were ineffective, he said. Dung ordered the Health Ministry to coordinate efforts to stop its spread and stronger efforts to boost sanitary conditions in areas with children. The Vietnam News quoted the health ministry as saying the number of casualties this year was "considerably high."

The deficit financing bill, which would allow the government to sell bonds needed to fund almost half of the budget, has languished in parliament as the ruling Democratic Party tussles with opposition parties that can use their control of the upper house to reject legislation. "Without this bill, the budget will collapse," Finance Minister Jun Azumi said on Friday, pleading for cooperation from the two largest opposition parties. "It doesn\'t matter which party is in power. I really hope that we can get a multi-partisan agreement on the deficit bill." If the bill is not passed, government spending would grind to a halt, the world\'s third-largest economy would be put in jeopardy and its standing among credit ratings agencies could suffer. Japan is not the only developed nation that is staring at an imminent fiscal crisis. Greece\'s debt-strapped government could run out of money within weeks unless it secures a 31.8 billion euro tranche of bailout funds from the European Union. The U.S. economy is facing $4 trillion worth of expiring tax cuts and automatic government spending reductions at the end of the year, and a standoff in Congress makes the chance of a compromise over the so-called "fiscal cliff" look dim. The impasse in Japan however comes just after Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda won over the opposition to pass an increase in sales tax in the lower house of parliament. However, a section of his party quit over the vote, and is poised to form a new party. Noda\'s Democrats still control a majority in the lower house of parliament, but ar',

Justices at the STF, as the country\'s top court is known, voted 10 to zero in favor of gay partnerships, setting a legal precedent in Latin America\'s largest country. One justice, Jose Antonio Dias Toffoli, refrained from voting, saying he had dealt previously with related cases. The decision grants gay couples most of the rights enjoyed by heterosexual partners, including pension benefits, inheritance and, some lawyers say, possibly the right to adopt children. Lower courts had ruled both in favor of and against partnerships, which are not governed by a specific law. "The freedom to pursue one\'s own sexuality is part of an individual\'s freedom of expression," said Justice Carlos Ayres Britto, the author of the ruling. The ruling makes Brazil the second South American nation after\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Argentinato allow gay partnerships. The majority of judges argued that the Constitution did not explicitly rule out gay partnerships and that these were an expression of the right to privacy and equality before the law. Gay activists celebrated the decision, saying the ruling shows the state is willing to defend the rights of citizens regardless of their sexual and race condition. "The degree of civilization of a country can be measured by the way people in a nation treat their homosexual community," newspaper O Globo\'s website cited Claudio Nascimento, head of Rio de Janeiro state\'s Gay, Lesbian and Transsexuals Committee, as saying. "It\'s a historic day for\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Brazil." Brazil\'s Roman Catholic Church had argued against the decision, saying the only union the Constitution referred to was that between a man and a woman.

Seasonally-adjusted data from the Labor Office showed that unemployment dropped for a fifth consecutive month in March by a stronger-than-expected 18,000 to a total of 2.841 million. The consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of 35 economists was for joblessness to drop by 10,000. "The resilience of the German Labor market bodes well for private consumption in the first half of the year," said ING economist Carsten Brzeski. "The mild March weather and almost unshattered business optimism seem be the most important drivers behind today\'s drop in unemployment." The German data is good news for Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble whose budget plans are based on strong tax revenues. The report contrasted with figures from\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0France\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0this week showing the jobless total rising for a 10th consecutive month to reach its highest level since October 1999. Germany\'s export-driven economy recovered quickly from the 2008/09 financial crisis but shrank by 0.2 percent at the end of last year as the euro zone\'s debt troubles and a global slowdown took a toll on exports and private consumption. However the economy has seemed to pick up slightly this year, leading some institutes to hike their growth forecasts and many economists to predict stable or rising output in the first three months of 2012, thereby avoiding the two successive quarters of contraction that define a recession. The Labor market has remained strong in the face of this phase of economic weakness, propping up consumer confidence, which has risen six out of seven months according to market research group GfK. Falling unemployment has also emboldened trade unions to demand higher wages, after years of restrained pay growth which boost',

      'content': "BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand announced new measures on Tuesday to protect tourists after five foreigners died mysteriously in one city in just over a month, saying they were likely poisoned by unidentified toxic chemicals or pesticides. Two Britons, a Frenchman, an American and a New Zealander died between January 11 and February 19 this year in northern Chiang Mai, Thailand's second-biggest city. Three of the victims' traveling companions also fell ill. The deaths drew negative media attention to a country that is one of the world's most popular tourist destinations, attracting some 14 million visitors a year to its beaches, mountains and sprawling capital, Bangkok. Thailand's Department of Disease Control listed actions that will be taken to prevent more illness in Chiang Mai and other key destinations for tourism. They included the close monitoring of the use of chemicals and pesticides in hotels, inspections of markets and street food vendors, health and safety training by local authorities, a review of investigation procedures and the setting-up of a website to advise tourists on potential health risks. A five-month investigation led by the Thai authorities with cooperation from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was largely inconclusive but found no evidence of criminal cause. Three cases were attributed to exposure to chemicals, pesticides or gas, while for two victims -- an elderly British couple -- there was no known cause. Tourism is a vital part of Thailand's economy, Southeast Asia's second-biggest, employing about 15 percent of the country's workforce and contributing about 6 percent of GDP.

      'content': 'Gunman kills one and then self in German court By Marcus Nagle LANDSHUT, Germany (Reuters) - A 60-year-old cook shot his sister-in-law, seriously wounded two other people and then killed himself in a courthouse shooting spree in the southern German town of Landshut Tuesday, police said. The man was embroiled in a legal battle with his in-laws over an inheritance row and suddenly opened fire with a revolver during a break in proceedings in the hallway of the court, state prosecutor Christoph Stroetz said. He told a news conference the man fired at two other people and then went into an adjacent chamber, where he shot himself. "One of the participants drew a weapon and shot at several people," police spokesman Leonard Mayer said. "One woman was fatally injured, two others (a lawyer and a woman) were injured but they are not in critical condition. The assailant went into another room and shot himself." Officials said there had been a long inheritance dispute over a house involving the victim and her six siblings. Mayer said there was no warning: "It came out of the blue." Officials said there was no metal detector because it is an administrative court and not a criminal court. The shooting took place less than a month after a school massacre in the southwestern town of Winnenden in which a total of 16 people were killed. Landshut is a town of around 62,000 in southern Bavaria. (Reporting by Erik Kirschbaum and Madeline Chambers, editing by Angus MacSwan) \xc3\x82\xc2\xa9 Thomson Reuters 2009. All rights reserved.

      'content': 'DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran has hanged a man it said was an agent for Israeli intelligence agency Mossad whom it convicted of killing one of its nuclear scientists in 2010, Iranian state media reported on Tuesday. Tehran has accused Israel and the United States of assassinating four Iranian scientists since 2010 in order to sabotage its nuclear program which the West suspects is hiding Iran\'s attempt to develop a nuclear weapons capability. While Israel has declined to comment on the killings, it regards Iran\'s nuclear program as an existential threat and has threatened military action against Tehran. Washington has denied any U.S. role. Twenty-four year old Majid Jamali Fashi was hanged at Tehran\'s Evin Prison after being sentenced to death in August last year for the murder of Massoud Ali-Mohammadi, Iran\'s state news agency quoted the central prosecutor\'s office as saying. It said he had confessed to the crime. Ali-Mohammadi was killed in January 2010 when a remote-controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle outside his home in Tehran went off. Tuesday\'s report said Fashi had confessed to travelling to Tel Aviv to receive training from Mossad before returning to Iran to plot the assassination. A spokesman for Iran\'s Atomic Energy Organization said at the time that Ali-Mohammadi, a 50-year-old Tehran University professor, was not involved in its activities. The most recent attack on an Iranian scientist occurred in January. Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan - a deputy director of the Natanz uranium enrichment facility - was killed when a magnetic bomb planted on his vehicle detonated. Israel has a policy of not commenting on the allegations but an unnamed Israeli source previously said the daylight killings provoked panic in surviving colleagues and generate a phenomenon Mossad veterans dub "virtual defection" which hinders Iran\'s nuclear progress. Last month, Iranian intelligence officials said they had arrested 15 people they called a "major terror and sabotage network with links to',

      'content': 'BERLIN (Reuters) - Four people were killed and at least one person seriously injured when a woman armed with a gun opened fire in and around a hospital in the southern German town of Loerrach, authorities said on Sunday. "The situation is under control," said a spokesman for local police. The woman was among the four dead, he added. Television pictures showed authorities had cordoned off several streets in the town near the Swiss border, where the shooting began at around 6 p.m.. Police said shots were first heard after an explosion in an apartment block in central Loerrach. Shortly afterwards, a woman armed with a gun ran out of the building, which caught fire. The woman entered the nearby St. Elisabethen-Krankenhaus hospital and fired off several rounds, police said. She was then shot dead in an exchange of fire with police. Police said two people were killed inside the hospital and that a police officer was seriously wounded. They added that the bodies of a man and a child were found in the apartment block, having previously said a woman and a girl were found dead there. Local state prosecutor Dieter Inhofer told ZDF television investigators believed the deaths were all linked. However, the motive for the killings was still unclear, he added. Germany has been debating tougher controls on gun ownership since a teenager went on the rampage in March 2009 in the southern town of Winnenden near Stuttgart, killing 15 people at his old school before shooting himself. The boy\'s father went on trial on Thursday charged with failing to secure his gun properly. Both Winnenden and Loerrach are in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. Germany\'s worst school shooting was in April 2002, when a gunman killed 17 people, including himself, at a high school in the eastern city of Erfurt.

Sites around the great pyramid at Giza, a Wonder of the Ancient World, the Sphinx and the cemetery at Sakkara have been nearly empty of tourists since a revolt started a month ago that ousted Hosni Mubarak, and now Egypt wants visitors to return. "In terms of reviving tourism, the problem is currently Libya not us. The whole region is very hot right now," Karim Mohsen, managing director of Sylvia Tours Egypt, said, referring to an uprising against Muammar Gaddafi in the western neighbor. "Libya is on the border with Egypt and what people see happening there is terrible and therefore they\'re afraid to come to the area," Mohsen told Reuters, in a view reflected by other tour operators and guides who expected several more idle weeks. Those trying to draw tourists back to cruises down the Nile and Egypt\'s ancient artifacts want to turn the nation\'s political turmoil to their advantage. One proposed slogan suggests the revolution is "One More Reason to Visit Egypt." Hundreds of students at Giza, visited by statesmen from Jimmy Carter to Napoleon and usually bustling with thousands of tourists, rallied at the weekend with "Egypt is Safe" signs, hoping to get the message over to the rest of the world. "Please tell your friends not to fear the revolution. This is the new Egypt and it welcomes, you," said Heba, 18. Life in Egypt is still far from normal, with many schools still shut, weekly mass protests at Tahrir Square, a curfew and tanks with soldiers at key intersections in Cairo. But in symbolic visits of confidence, prominent U.S. Congressmen John McCain and Joseph Lieberman appeared in the square at the weekend. They join British Prime Minister David Cameron and others who have recently made the trip. ',

Violent defiance of the authority of the state is rare in Vietnam but land disputes are a growing source of friction in a country where the state owns all land and usage rights are not always clearly defined or respected. "The detentions are to investigate who was behind this, inciting the people into opposition," VnExpress (vnexpress.net) quoted the head of the Hung Yen provincial government office, Bui Huy Thanh, as saying. On Tuesday, residents in the Hung Yen district of Van Giang near Hanoi clashed with riot police and other security forces mobilised to take control of a plot of land to be developed as part of a satellite city project called Ecopark. People in Van Giang say they were not properly consulted over the repossession of the land while the local government says they were. On Monday night, many people camped out on the land to try to protect it after the authorities said they would forcibly repossess the plot. The next morning police moved in. VnExpress quoted Thanh as saying about 1,000 police and other security forces were deployed for the operation. Villagers and other witnesses had estimated the number at between 2,000 and 4,000. Thanh said there was no army involved and no guns were fired during the episode, but he said police used two teargas canisters to disperse a crowd that was blocking a road, the website reported. Video and photos posted online shows police in riot gear at the scene, as well as uniformed police and other men in civilian clothing wearing red arm bands beating up a man. The sound of multiple explosions similar to gunfire can be heard. In January, fish farmer Doan Van Vuon became something of a folk hero after his relatives used homemade explosives and guns ',

Surrounded by towering turbines in every direction, the town of La Ventosa - which means "the windy place" in Spanish - is at the heart of a wind power boom in the country. Mexico, the world\'s 14th biggest economy, still punches well below its weight in terms of wind energy, ranking 24th on the planet in installed capacity last year, according to the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC). But the market is growing fast. By the end of this year, the national wind energy association expects Mexico to jump to number 20 on the list, which is dominated by wealthy European nations, the United States,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0China\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and India. "We\'re talking about the largest growth in wind power projects anywhere in the world," President Felipe Calderon said recently near La Ventosa at the opening of Latin America\'s largest wind park owned by Spanish company Acciona SA, a long row of turbines whirring behind him. Producing just 3 megawatts of wind power in 2005, Mexico now has nearly 400 times that, and will have 2 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2012, says the Mexican Wind Energy Association, or AMEE. Though it only accounts for a fraction of the 2011 global total of nearly 240 GW, by the beginning of next year, Mexico\'s installed wind power potential should equal almost 4 percent of the country\'s own energy needs. The planned build-up will make Mexico\'s wind industry the fastest growing in the Group of 20 economic powers this year, said Steve Sawyer, secretary general of the Brussels-based GWEC. He also said Mexico\'s net addition to installed capacity in 2012 could be the fifth highest of any country. Most of the increase will come from giant wind farms along the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the narrowest point between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Eighteen',

Iranians have grappled with increased obstacles to using the Internet since opposition supporters used social networking sites to organise widespread protests after the disputed 2009 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The country is preparing to hold parliamentary elections on March 2, the first time Iranians will go to the polls since President Ahmadinejad\'s disputed re-election. The government denied any fraud in the vote, which ignited street protests that were crushed violently by security services after eight months. The new Internet blockade affected the most common form of secure connections from Friday, according to outside experts and Iranian bloggers. Traffic was said to have returned to normal on Monday. "I haven\'t been able to open pages for days but now it\'s working again, although slowly," said Hamid Reza, a 20-year-old student in Tehran, who was reluctant to give his surname. The cut-off appeared to target all encrypted international websites outside Iran that depend on the Secure Sockets Layer protocol, which display addresses beginning with https, according to Earl Zmijewski of Renesys, a U.S. company that tracks Internet traffic worldwide. Google, which uses SSL for its Gmail service, reported that traffic from Iran to its email system fell precipitously. Iran\'s Ministry of Communications and Technology denied knowing of the disruption, saying the origin was elsewhere. "The government is testing different tools," said Hamed Behravan, who repo',

       'content': 'By Manny Mogato MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines was already considered among the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist even before 27 were killed on Monday in an election-related massacre. The National Union of Journalists has said 59 journalists had been killed in the Philippines since 2001, without counting this week\'s victims. Reporters are routinely threatened, some are shot and some kidnapped. But this week\'s killings have exponentially increased risks, reporters and media analysts said on Friday. The killing of so many journalists on assignment in a single incident is difficult to imagine even in Iraq, Afghanistan or Somalia, they said. "For years, we hid behind our press IDs (identification cards) as a shield against danger in covering conflict areas in the southern Philippines," broadcast journalist Ed Lingao told Reuters. "But this incident has made us realize our press IDs can no longer protect us. It\'s a piece of paper. It cannot stop a bullet." The journalists were accompanying the family of a politician to file his candidacy for next year\'s elections. They were attacked by gunmen suspected to be supporters of a rival clan. The candidate had decided against filing his nomination himself because of safety worries and had sent his wife and sisters, and the journalists, in the belief that they would be safe from attack. Arlyn dela Cruz, a television reporter who was once kidnapped by Islamic militants, said the killings would prompt caution. "These killings show us how vulnerable our local reporters are to rebels, private armies and warlords," dela Cruz said, adding the massacre would have a more direct impact on provincial reporters and freelancers not protected by large organizations. The Philippines has a free-wheeling press and usually the media is held in high regard. Even communist rebels and Muslim radical outfits routinely keep in touch with newspapers and television channels and seek to put out their point of view. Journalists ha',

Material damage is estimated to be some $40 billion if there is a quake of 7.7 magnitude, with the rescue operation covering one million people, according to the report produced by the Japan International Cooperation Agency and the city council. Another 135,000 people could be badly injured and more than half a million could be left homeless, according to the scenario. Istanbul, like many areas of Turkey, is close to a major fault line and has suffered major earthquakes in the past. Some 18,000 people -- 1,000 of them in Istanbul -- were killed in a quake in northwest Turkey in August 1999 which had a magnitude of 7.4. Many of the deaths were blamed on sub-standard building. Work on the report was conducted by four Japanese and 10 Turkish scientists and a team of engineers and was based on a night-time population of nine million people in the city. The report assessed scenarios based on earthquakes with magnitudes of 6.9, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.7. It said 70,000-90,000 would be killed in the case of a quake of 7.5 or 7.7 magnitude. The city council has prepared an earthquake master plan to cope with such a scenario, focused on assessing the strength of buildings and pulling them down or reinforcing them if necessary. It did not give a forecast timescale for any possible earthquake. Experts have said previously there was 50 percent chance of a quake with a magnitude of at least seven hitting the city within three decades.",

Earlier on Thursday, Trabzonspor filed a civil law suit at an Istanbul court accusing Emre, as he is popularly known, of abusing Zokora. The accusation, denied by Emre, cast another cloud over 2011 league champions Fenerbahce whose chairman is currently on trial as a suspect in a multi-million dollar match-fixing scandal that rocked Turkish football last year. Zokora first levelled the accusation against Emre at a news conference following Fenerbahce\'s 2-0 home win in Istanbul over Trabzonspor. "Emre and I had an argument during the game. I beg your pardon for saying this, but he insulted me by saying nigger. What upsets me more is how disgraceful it is for a player who has African team mates like Sow and Yobo to insult an African from another team," Zokora said. The following day, Emre told a news conference that he had abused Zokora verbally in English without using racist terms, and that such abuse was commonplace during matches. "If I have even a little bit of racism, may God take my heart away from this body," Emre said. The Turkish Football Federation (TFF) subsequently referred the matter to the disciplinary committee, which decided on the ban. "Due to the insult to the player of the rival team, it has been decided with the majority of votes to punish Fenerbahce player Emre Belozoglu by sanctioning a ban for two official games," the PFDK said on its website. Both teams are playing in the playoffs against Galatasaray and Besiktas for the domestic championship. Trabzonspor were runners-up to Fenerbahce last year, but took Fener\'s place in the Champions League due to the match-fixing probe. (Writing by Ece Toksabay and',

Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Chairman Mohammed Yaseen said the base price for the auction would be $210 million.

He said the amount bidders would deposit with initial expressions of interest -- to indicate the seriousness of a bid -- would be $31.5 million and licence terms would be from eight to 15 years. Pakistan had more than 111 million mobile phone users in October 2011, according to the PTA, equivalent to around 65 percent of all Pakistanis.

The unemployed man killed a bailiff and locksmith who tried to evict him from his flat, as well as the new owner. Police found the man\'s 55-year-old partner dead in bed and said he had shot her as well. "Special forces broke into the apartment at 11.48 after smelling something burning and found four dead bodies. One of them was the gunman," said Karlsruhe police chief Roland Lay. Investigators described an "execution-like" scene in the three-roomed flat, which had been put up for compulsory sale in April due to payment arrears, suggesting he had planned the killings. He set fire to the carpet before shooting himself. "There was nothing the police could have done to avoid this tragic and terrible situation," Gunter Spitz of the local public prosecutors\' office told a news conference. Police found a shotgun, rifle, two pistols, ammunition and a dummy grenade in the apartment, all of it illegally purchased, said Spitz. The gunman, who was not named, invited the eviction team into the flat then pulled a gun on them, shooting the bailiff in the leg when he did not obey. The locksmith was shot in the head and chest after trying to disarm the gunman, police said. Drinking beer and smoking throughout the ordeal, the gunman eventually freed the social worker, who heard five shots after he left the apartment. Karlsruhe, with nearly 300,000 inhabitants, is located near the French border and is home to Germany\'s Constitutional Court.

       'content': 'Anti-government, hate groups growing: report By Colleen Jenkins WINSTON-SALEM, North Carolina (Reuters) - The number of hate and anti-government groups in the United States continued to rise last year, fueled by racial tensions, conspiracy theories and anger over economic inequality, according to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The most explosive growth came from the so-called Patriot movement, whose adherents view the federal government as their enemy. The Patriot movement reached a peak in 1996, a year after right-wing extremist Timothy McVeigh set off a truck bomb outside the Oklahoma City federal building, killing 168 people. McVeigh and a co-conspirator were convicted, and McVeigh was executed. The number of Patriot groups, a largely rural phenomenon sometimes referred to as the militia movement, increased to 1,274 groups in 2011 from 824 in 2010, the report released on Thursday said. The number of those organizations has swelled in recent years since the economy slumped into recession and Democratic President Barack Obama, the country\'s first black president, was elected in 2008, said the law center, which has tracked extremist groups for three decades. A backlash against federal bail outs of the bank and auto industries, and discredited allegations that Obama was not born in the United States and therefore disqualified to be president, provided believers with the rationale to join such groups, according to the report. Heated political rhetoric from this year\'s presidential campaign could attract more adherents, said Mark Potok, senior fellow at the center and editor of the report. "The campaign season has simply added fuel to the fire," Potok said. These groups vehemently oppose Obama and abhor the possibility that he could be re-elected to a second term in November. "To them, that\'s a horror show," Potok said. The center counted 1,018 hate groups in the United States last year, up from 1,002 in 2010. The number of groups have been increasing sin',

Authorities closed the websites for spreading rumors of "military vehicles entering Beijing and something wrong going on in Beijing," Xinhua news agency said late on Friday, citing a spokesman with the State Internet Information Office (SIIO). The spokesman said that two popular microblogging sites also had been "criticized and punished accordingly". The March 15 ouster of Bo Xilai as party chief of the inland city of Chongqing, who was linked to a scandal involving a senior aide, has shaken China\'s Communist Party as it readies for a top leadership change later this year. After Bo was sacked, popular microblogs, including those run by Sina Corp. and Tencent Holdings Ltd, were awash with speculation about a government coup. Sina and Tencent shut the comment functions on their popular microblogging sites from March 31 to April 3 to "clean up rumors and other illegal information spreading" through the site, Xinhua said. On Saturday, Sina\'s Weibo users could still make posts, though other users could not respond. Beijing-based microbloggers had previously been ordered to register their real names by mid-March or face unspecified legal consequences. Many users fear Internet restrictions like those for Beijing and other regions are aimed at muzzling often raucous, and perhaps most significantly, anonymous, online chat in a country where the Internet offers a rare opportunity for open discussion.

Thousands of doses of the faulty medicines were freely provided to patients with heart problems at the government-run Punjab Institute of Cardiology in the eastern city of Lahore. "We are trying to retrieve all the medicines given out at this hospital," said Jehanzeb Khan, the Punjab health secretary. Thousands of prescriptions were handed out at the facility in the last month, hospital officials said. Investigators suspect bits of metal in the pills are responsible for the symptoms, which include heavy bleeding. Over 100 people have been admitted to hospitals in Lahore because of symptoms caused by the faulty medicines. Sources at the Punjab health department told Reuters that the death toll from the medicines is much higher than the official count. The government has banned five drugs believed to be contaminated, and police have arrested three people in connection with the deaths. At least one pharmaceutical factory, not named by police, has been sealed. The provincial government formed a committee to probe the deaths. Faisal Masood, a member of the committee, said the deaths began last month. "Patients were coming in with symptoms similar to dengue fever. But then we realized it wasn\'t that," he said. "The one thing common in all patients was heart disease, and that they were getting medicines from the Punjab Institute of Cardiology."

The natural resources attracting investors and industry are of a simple variety: wind, sunshine, agricultural products and farm waste such as liquid manure. The rush to tap green resources in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state is reminiscent of the frenzies that came with gold or oil discoveries in past centuries. The buzz can be felt in towns and sparkling new factories across the Baltic shore state. "Renewable energy has become extremely valuable for our state," said its premier, Erwin Selling, in an interview with Reuters. "It\'s just a great opportunity -- producing renewable energy and creating manufacturing jobs. "From an industrial point of view we\'d been one of Germany\'s weaker areas. But the country is abandoning nuclear power. That will work only if there\'s a corresponding -- and substantial -- increase in renewables. It\'ll be one of Germany\'s most important sectors in the future. We want to be up there leading the way." The federal government did an about-face on nuclear power after the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex in\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Japan, set off by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Germany shut eight nuclear plants and will close the other nine by 2022. Germany is a world leader in renewable energy and wants an even larger share of the $211 billion global market. A fifth of its electricity comes from renewables, up from 6 percent in 2000, and it aims to boost this to 35 percent in 2020. There are some clouds on the horizon. State-mandated incentives, which fueled a private investment boom, have been cut, squeezing margins in sectors such as solar energy. There have also been delays in expanding and upgrading the national grid of high-voltage transmission lines from sparsely populated coastal regions such as Mecklenburg-Vorpommer',

       'content': 'MAKHACHKALA, Russia (Reuters) - Suicide bombers killed 12 people and wounded 110 in attacks on a police post on the outskirts of the capital of Russia\'s Dagestan region, local investigators and law enforcement sources said on Friday. The attacks outside Makhachkala late on Thursday were the deadliest in months, undermining efforts by Russian security forces to contain an Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus near Sochi, where Russia will host the Winter Olympics in 2014. More than a decade after federal troops toppled an Islamist government in Chechnya, also in the North Caucasus, security forces are fighting militants whose ranks are swollen by anger at poverty, clan feuds and pervasive corruption. The first suicide bomber detonated a bomb when police stopped a vehicle to check documents, a statement by the National Anti-Terrorist Committee said. The second explosion came when fire brigades and ambulances arrived, causing additional casualties. A witness at the scene said a fire truck was reduced to charred wreckage. "After the blast, only the wheels of the truck remained whole," the witness told reporters. Local officials said that in addition to the 12 killed in the blast, 90 had been taken to hospital and 20 were treated at the scene. "Fragments of human bodies are scattered at the post," Russia\'s Interfax news agency quoted a law enforcement official as saying. Local investigators said they had found the remains of a man and a woman suspected of being the suicide bombers. Thursday\'s blasts were heard by residents far away in the centre of the provincial capital of Makhachkala. The attacks fell just three days before Vladimir Putin, who sent troops 12 years ago to crush rebellion in Chechnya, is to be sworn in as president. The unofficial Islamist website www.kavkazcenter.com said the police post was almost completely destroyed. A nearby gas pipeline also was damaged during the attack, RIA news agency reported.

       'content': 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A vast region of the Amazon forest in Brazil was home to a complex of ancient towns in which about 50,000 people lived, according to scientists assisted by satellite images of the region. The scientists, whose findings were published on Thursday in the journal Science, described clusters of towns and smaller villages connected by complex road networks and housing a society doomed by the arrival of Europeans five centuries ago. European colonists and the diseases they brought with them probably killed most of the inhabitants, the researchers said. The settlements, consisting of networks of walled towns and smaller villages organized around a central plaza, are now almost entirely overgrown by the forest. "These are not cities, but this is urbanism, built around towns," University of Florida anthropologist Mike Heckenberger said in a statement. "If we look at your average medieval town or your average Greek polis, most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the Amazon. Only the ones we find are much more complicated in terms of their planning," Heckenberger added. Helped by satellite imagery, the researchers spent more than a decade uncovering and mapping the lost communities. Prior to the arrival of Europeans starting in 1492, the Americas were home to many prosperous and impressive societies and large cities. These findings add to the understanding of the various pre-Columbian civilizations. The existence of the ancient settlements in the Upper Xingu region of the Amazon in north-central Brazil means what many experts had considered virgin tropical forests were in fact heavily affected by past human activity, the scientists said. The U.S. and Brazilian scientists worked with a member of the Kuikuro, an indigenous Amazonian people descended from settlements\' original inhabitants.

Brazil\'s Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira told reporters the government was creating a "crisis cabinet" to investigate the jump in destruction of the forest, which mostly occurred in the center-west farming state of Mato Grosso. The area of Amazon forest lost in the two months totaled 229 square miles (593 square km), up 473 percent from the same period a year ago, preliminary satellite data showed. In the period from last August to April it rose 27 percent, raising the prospect that the closely watched annual deforestation rate will rise this year. The unexpected leap, at a time of year when deforestation is usually low, comes as Brazil\'s Congress is locked in a heated debate over a law that would effectively give amnesty to many farmers who have illegally cleared land. Environmentalists say the bill gives too much weight to the economic interests of the influential farm lobby and will set back recent progress in reducing destruction of the world\'s largest forest. "You have 300-400 lawmakers here in Brasilia sending the message that profiting from deforestation will be amnestied, that crime pays," Marcio Astrini, an Amazon campaigner for Greenpeace, told Reuters. "The only relevant factor is the forest code. It is a gigantic rise." DELAYED VOTE Congress delayed a vote on the new forest code last week after days of often acrimonious debate, but it is expected to go ahead next week. A bill that is viewed as rowing back conservation in the Amazon could prove embarrassing for President Dilma Rousseff, who pledged during her campaign last year to maintain Brazil\'s commitment to protect the Amazon.

The strike, for higher wages, began early Friday and follows an ongoing walkout by police in the northeastern state of Bahia. There, police stopped work on January 31, unleashing a crime wave with more than 150 homicides, looting, and vandalism mostly concentrated in the capital city of Salvador. In Rio, the police job action is not expected to cause similar chaos because strike leaders agreed to a minimum level of service despite the protests. However, the willingness of Brazil\'s police to stage walkouts when they are most needed has unsettled many and called into question the overall state of preparedness in a country with increasing first-world ambitions. As residents went about their business on Friday in the seaside city of 6.4 million people, only a handful of precincts appeared to struggle with a shortage of officers. Still, authorities were ready with emergency plans that could deploy more than 14,000 federal troops across the city and the surrounding state of the same name. President Dilma Rousseff last week deployed more than 4,000 troops to Salvador to try to restore order. Given a growing call for walkouts nationwide by police officers demanding higher salaries, state and federal officials prepared for similar measures in Rio. "There is a contingency plan," said Colonel Frederico Caldas, a spokesman for the police force. "But it isn\'t necessary with the current situation." The strike comes just one week before Rio\'s famous carnival celebrations and coincides with the start of hundreds of informal street parades, known as blocos. As many as 850,000 tourists are expected to hit the beaches and palm-tree lined promenades of Brazil\'s second-biggest city',

The hacker activist group Anonymous used the "Op_Russia" twitter account to publicise the attack, saying "kremlin.ru - TANGO DOWN" and "Anonymous shuts down Kremlin\'s websites". Internet users in Russia said they were unable to access the www.kremlin.ru website for several minutes on Wednesday. "All the relevant departments are taking the necessary measures to counteract (such) attacks," a spokesman for the Kremlin Internet security division said. "This is routine work. There is always some external influence. Today we are witnessing a splash of activity (by the attackers) ... (But) they failed to achieve their goal." Putin won a presidential election in March and on Monday launched his third term as head of state, a day after some 50,000 protesters took to the streets of Moscow over what they called a rigged vote. Police forcibly dispersed the rally, although it had been approved by the Moscow city authorities, and several opposition leaders were detained. Last week, Anonymous said it would attack Russian government websites in support of opposition protests. Anonymous hacked into the emails of a pro-Kremlin youth organisation earlier this year in what it said was a response to a growing number of hacker assaults by pro-government groups on independent news outlets and opposition bloggers.

No one came to his assistance. But all of a sudden, a man contacted Ainul and approached him with a proposal that sounded like a way out of his immediate financial woes and also out of the long-term, grinding poverty that is the situation of many others across Bangladesh. The man asked him to sell a kidney for a price so high that it would give him the chance of paying off all his debts and even set up a small business to support his five-member family. After hesitating at first, Ainul, 36, took the bait and travelled to Dhaka, the capital - where he had never been - with the broker, who took him in turn to another man who claimed to be a physician. "I chose to sell my kidney as I needed money to pay back the accumulated loan instalments, for which the lenders were pressing me hard. I had no other alternative," Ainul told Reuters. Arrangements were made quickly and Ainul returned home a few days later with one of his kidneys gone. He received 170,000 taka ($2,300) and was pleased, since he was assured he would have no problem working even harder than before. But Ainul soon found himself increasingly weak and unable to drive his van, leaving him with no ability to work. Ainul is just one of many poor Bangladeshi villagers to fall victim to an organized "kidney racket" that sells organs both inside the country and overseas -- a racket whose discovery, as reported in local media recently, set off a furore. Police and reporters fanned out, trying to locate victims and brokers. Only close family members and relatives can donate kidneys for transplant in Bangladesh, according to law.

       'content': 'Washington state third grader shoots classmate By Laura L. Myers (Reuters) - A boy in the third grade at a Washington state elementary school shot a female classmate on Wednesday, critically wounding the girl, authorities said. The girl, 8-year-old Amina Kocer-Bowman, was rushed by air ambulance to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle and wheeled into surgery for a gunshot wound to the stomach, hospital spokeswoman Susan Gregg said. Gregg said Kocer-Bowman remained in critical condition following the 90-minute surgery. "She\'s critical, she\'s very sick," Gregg said about five hours after the 1:30 p.m. PST shooting in a classroom at Armin Jahr Elementary School in Bremerton, Washington. The spokeswoman said she didn\'t expect the girl\'s condition to change overnight. The 9-year-old boy, who was not identified by authorities, was taken into custody by police, a Bremerton School District spokeswoman said, and the school was locked down before students were allowed to leave. "We do know the gun and the student were found," Bremerton School District spokeswoman Patty Glaser said. Glaser said police were still investigating the incident, which took place shortly before the end of the school day. Armin Jahr Elementary teaches about 400 students in grades K-5. "It\'s very early in the investigation. As a parent I can only imagine. Our prayers go out to the families," Glaser said. The district said the school would reopen on Thursday and that grief counselors would be on hand for students, staff and parents A spokesman for police in Bremerton, a city of some 40,000 people about 15 miles west of Seattle, could not immediately be reached for comment.

       'content': 'China lead pollution poisons 160 children-Xinhua BEIJING, March 4 (Reuters) - Lead emission from factories and the natural environment in China\'s manufacturing heart of Guangdong has poisoned 160 children, Xinhua said on Sunday in the country\'s latest case of unfettered industrial toxins. Children from Dongtang town in Renhua country were found to have "elevated" levels of lead in their blood after inhaling lead-contaminated air and eating food tainted with lead, Xinhua said. Th e natural level of lead in Dongtang is also higher than usual as the town sits on a lead-zinc ore belt which raises the lead content in the soil, Xinhua said. The report did not name the factories responsible for the lead emissions and was based on preliminary investigations that tested the blood samples of 531 residents last month. Lead poisoning is prevalent in China and has sparked protests in the past among angry parents of children hurt by heavy metal pollution. Lead is especially damaging to children as it can impede learning and affect behaviours. To counter widespread public anger, Beijing has promised to crack down on lead pollution. An industry body said last May China could shut three quarters of lead-acid battery plants in the next two or three years to cut local lead demand. China is the world\'s largest consumer of refined lead, with 70 percent used for making batteries. Lead poisoning builds up through regular exposure to small amounts of lead and damages the nervous and reproductive systems, kidneys, as well as causing high blood pressure and anaemia. In 2009, protesters broke into one smelting plant they blamed for the lead poisoning of more than 600 children, smashing trucks and tearing down fences before the police stopped them.

Egypt\'s first parliamentary vote since Hosni Mubarak was ousted began on Monday and the first round of voting is being held over two days watched by judges, international monitors and local observers. Using twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to offer live broadcasts of everything they come across, voters -- many of whom are heading to the polls for the first time -- are also providing detailed descriptions of their experiences. "In the past I used to go down myself to monitor the elections, now everyone in the country is doing it. Isn\'t this something to be happy about?," Bothaina Kamel, Egypt\'s first female presidential candidate and activist, said on twitter. Many activists are networking with official monitoring groups, distributing numbers for rights groups and some have even set up a twitter hashtag "sharek" or participate. "Voters, be ready with your mobile phone cameras to capture any violations," voter Mourad Ghareeb wrote on twitter. Keeping with the trend, widely-read newspapers like Masry al Youm and Shorouk have launched online portals to exclusively cover the elections and offer their readers a chance to upload videos and written reports of violations they see. They report violations ranging from polls not opening on time to unstamped ballots to parties illegally campaigning outside polling stations. Their grievances are taken up by the judicial election commission responsible for the vote or other rights groups networking with local observers. The participation has in turn helped the media keep closer accounts ',

       'content': 'Sewage dumping disrupts water supply in China city BEIJING (Reuters) - About 50,000 residents in a southern Chinese city had their water supplies disrupted after a fish farm discharged sewage into the local water source, state media said Sunday, in the country\'s latest pollution incident. Authorities in Foshan city, an industrial part of export- dependent Guangdong province close to Hong Kong, discovered the problem Saturday and immediately stopped taking water from the stream, the official Xinhua news agency reported. "Initial investigations showed the aquatic farm ... had discharged waste water into the stream," it said. The part of the city affected has since taken measures to make up for the lost supply, and as of Sunday the number of people facing disruption had come down to around 1,000 people, Xinhua added. Pollution, especially when it threatens relatively prosperous urban citizens, is a growing source of concern for Chinese people and has even sparked protests, a major worry for the stability-obsessed ruling Communist Party. In 2005, a chemical explosion sent an 80-km long benzene slick flowing along the Songhua River, forcing tap water to be suspended in cities in Northeast China and Russia in the dead of winter. The accident was initially covered up. In recent weeks, two water disasters have come to public attention -- waste from metal processing plants sent cadmium levels soaring in the Longjiang river, which ultimately flows into the heavily populated Pearl River Delta, and a South Korean chemicals barge sank in the Yangtze River, releasing phenol that caused tap water to smell strange in the city of Zhenjiang.

       'content': 'By Michael Martina BEIJING (Reuters) - New music copyright rules proposed by China threaten to roll back protection for musicians and record companies and hand the government control over royalties, moves that have sparked an outcry from the local music industry and among legal experts. The draft rules from the National Copyright Administration partly aimed at reining in rampant piracy would, if they become law, also apply to foreign music distributed in China, which has long been a frontline in battles over intellectual property. Under the proposal, certain music rights would only have a three-month limit, allowing others to use, record or distribute songs after that period at government-set rates. Rights\' holders would also lose veto power over who can use their work. "It\'s as if I had a house for rent and somebody else is telling me who the tenant must be and how much to charge for rent," said Zhan Hua, the chief executive officer of Taihe Rye Music Co Ltd, a well-known Chinese music label. Some lawyers say the draft represents such a significant rollback in protections enjoyed by producers of creative works in other countries that it is likely to be revised. Copyright terms in many Western countries extend rights 70 years or more beyond an artist\'s death. China offers 50 years, although enforcement is weak. While the draft rules would not negate that 50-year right in name, critics say they provide a workaround that essentially turns private intellectual property public. The rules also do not spell out what sort of royalties musicians would be entitled to. The rules were proposed last month and China\'s copyright authorities have said they are seeking opinions from within the industry and abroad until the end of April. They argue that the rules will help prevent piracy in a country where knock-off CDs are common and songs can be downloaded free online, as users will be required to register, list the copyright, and pay royalties set by authorities.

The legislation, which won final approval by the state Senate on Wednesday, bucks a national trend among municipalities toward outlawing behaviors associated with homelessness such as eating, sleeping and panhandling in public spaces. Among other steps, the Rhode Island law would guarantee homeless people the right to use public sidewalks, parks and transportation as well as public buildings, like anyone else "without discrimination on the basis of his or her housing status." It guarantees a "reasonable expectation of privacy" with respect to personal belongings similar to that of people who have homes. While other laws already guarantee many of the rights specified in this legislation, supporters say it was necessary due to widespread discrimination. "I think we\'ve set the bar high in the U.S. for homeless people, and I\'m very proud of that," said Senator John Tassoni, a sponsor of the bill. Rhode Island is the smallest of the 50 U.S. states. Tassoni and other homeless advocates said Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee would likely sign the bill in coming days. Chafee\'s office said it could not comment until the bill was formally presented to the governor for signing. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE HOMELESS Roughly 643,000 people are homeless on any given night in the United States, experts say. "It\'s important as a standalone piece of legislation but also as it\'s juxtaposed with other communities that are in the process of criminalizing homelessness," said Neil Donovan, executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless. "This just affirms the rights and existence of the unhoused in America." Cities including Philadelphia, San Francisco and St. Louis recently passed ordinances targ',

Heribert Rech, interior minister of the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, told a news conference on Thursday that a 17-year old in Bavaria had communicated with Tim Kretschmer in a chatroom on the night before he entered his former school and killed students and teachers. "I\'ve had enough," Rech quoted from the chatroom message, which appeared to have been left by Kretschmer only a few hours before the massacre in the town of Winnenden. "Always the same. Everybody\'s laughing at me. No one sees my potential. I\'m serious. I have weapons and I will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue. Maybe I\'ll get away. Listen out. You will hear of me tomorrow. Remember the place\'s name: Winnenden." Rech said Kretschmer\'s chatroom partner had not taken the message seriously at the time but had told his father after he saw the reports of the shootings. Kretschmer, who police say shot himself after his killing spree, had been treated for depression last year but had broken off his treatment in September, Rech said.

       'content': 'China issues new rules to limit foreign TV shows BEIJING, Feb 14 (Reuters) - China\'s media regulator has issued new rules banning foreign television shows from being shown at primetime as the country tries to encourage domestic programming, state media reported on Tuesday. Foreign television series must be capped at a total of 50 episodes and the running time for an imported series must not exceed 25 percent of the total time a given channel dedicates to broadcasting such shows, the official China Daily reported. Most foreign television series shown on Chinese channels are from Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and India. U.S.-made shows are highly popular, but mostly watched online or via pirated DVDs which are widely and cheaply available on the streets. According to the announcement by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, Chinese stations are prohibited from airing foreign series between 7 pm and 10 pm, and must not "intensively" broadcast shows from just one country. Chinese networks are forbidden too from airing unapproved shows produced by companies outside of China and foreign series that contain violent or vulgar material, the rules state. "Regulatory bodies around the country must increase their supervision over foreign television shows broadcast on television stations at all levels, and increase fines levied for those who break the rules," it said. The China Daily said the regulations were "to protect domestic cultural products and ... help create a favourable environment for TV shows made by companies on the Chinese mainland". China periodically tries reining in its state-run television channels, which increasingly have to rely on attracting advertisers and therefore viewers as government subsidies are reduced. In 2002, Beijing pulled the plug on the Taiwan-made soap opera "Meteor Garden", fearing that the decadent lifestyle portrayed by boy band "F4" would corrupt young Chinese minds.

       'content': 'BEIJING, March 12 (Reuters) - In the latest trouble to hit China\'s beleaguered railways, workers are scrambling to repair a new high-speed track that collapsed in central China due to heavy rain and possibly poor construction, said local media.China\'s railways ministry has been plagued by scandals and missteps. A July 2011 crash of a high-speed train killed 40 people and raised concerns about the safety of the fast-growing network and threatened plans to export high-speed technology.Heavy rain last Friday collapsed a section of a 291 kms (180 mile) high-speed rail link in central China, set to open in May, state news agency Xinhua said on Monday, citing local authorities.There were no reports of any injuries from the collapsed track, said Xinhua. The railway in Hubei province will eventually link the provincial capital Wuhan and Yichang city.Time-Weekly, a semi-official newspaper, in early March cited a whistle-blower, Ni Hongjun, saying that he had tried to warn the railways ministry in 2010 that the Wuhan-Yichang rail link was at risk from heavy rain.He said the construction company building the high-speed railway was using earth instead of gravel and that earth can be softened when heavy rains occur, leaving the railway "facing a major security risk".China\'s cabinet criticised the railways ministry last December for lax safety standards and poor handling of the July 2010 crash, but said it remained committed to high-speed rail.(Reporting by Sui-Lee Wee; Editing by Michael Perry)',

Mexico\'s attorney general\'s office could not immediately confirm the reports of the grisly discovery in Mante and police officials in the crime-ridden city were not immediately available for comment. Mexican media said the body parts belonged to 10 men and four women and the message was directed at the Gulf cartel. In a separate incident on June 7, 14 dismembered bodies were discovered inside a truck in Mante, located in the south of Tamaulipas state, which borders Texas and is one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in Mexico\'s drug war. More than 55,000 people have been killed in the conflict since President Felipe Calderon sent in the army to fight drug gangs shortly after he took office in December 2006. Calderon\'s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, appears likely to lose power in the presidential election on July 1, due partly to rising frustration with the drug-related violence. This week, Mexico was left red-faced after authorities admitted they had mistakenly claimed to have captured a son of the country\'s most-wanted man, drug lord Joaquin "Shorty" Guzman.

Voters swarmed to the polls in a generally peaceful atmosphere despite the unrest that marred the election run-up, when 42 people were killed in protests demanding an immediate transition from military to civilian rule. "We want to make a difference, although we are depressed by what the country has come to," said Maha Amin, a 46-year-old pharmacy lecturer, before she voted in an upscale Cairo suburb. The ruling army council, which has already extended polling to a second day, kept voting stations open an extra two hours until 9 p.m. "to accommodate the high voter turnout." The Muslim Brotherhood\'s party and other Islamists expect to do well in the parliamentary election staggered over the next six weeks, but much remains uncertain in Egypt\'s complex and unfamiliar voting system of party lists and individuals. Political transformation in Egypt, traditional leader of the Arab world, will reverberate across the Middle East, where a new generation demanding democratic change has already toppled or challenged the leaders of Tunisia, Libya,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Syria\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and Yemen. Parliament\'s lower house will be Egypt\'s first nationally elected body since Mubarak\'s fall and those credentials alone may enable it to dilute the military\'s monopoly of power. A high turnout throughout the election would give it legitimacy. Despite a host of reported electoral violations and lax supervision exploited by some groups, election monitors reported no systematic Mubarak-style campaign to rig the polls.

       'content': 'German president resigns in setback for Merkel By Noah Barkin and Madeline Chambers BERLIN (Reuters) - Angela Merkel\'s hand-picked choice for the ceremonial post of president resigned Friday in a scandal over political favors, dealing a blow to the German chancellor in the midst of the euro zone debt crisis. In a curt five-minute statement at the Bellevue presidential palace, Christian Wulff acknowledged that he had lost the trust of the German people, making it impossible to continue in a role that is meant to serve as a moral compass for the nation. "For this reason it is no longer possible for me to exercise the office of president at home and abroad as required," said Wulff, standing next to his wife Bettina. The search for a successor to Wulff could become a distraction for Merkel at a time when her government is embroiled in tough talks on a second bailout package for Greece, although analysts said they expected any impact on the negotiations to be limited. Merkel postponed a Friday trip to Rome, where she was to hold talks on the debt crisis with Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, to deal with the fallout from Wulff\'s departure. She made a brief statement after his announcement, saying she regretted his departure and would seek talks with opposition parties to find a candidate to replace him. The chancellor is riding a wave of popularity in Germany for her handling of the crisis, but the departure of Wulff raises questions about her judgment because she forced through his appointment in 2010 over a strong opposition candidate most Germans favored. He is the second president to step down in less than two years. His predecessor, former International Monetary Fund chief Horst Koehler, resigned unexpectedly after coming under fire for comments he made about the German mission in Afghanistan and failing to get strong backing from Merkel. The resignation is likely to embolden the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens, who have shied away from criticizing Me',

Brazil's first government-run condom factory, located in northwestern Acre state, will produce 100 million condoms a year, the health ministry said in a statement. The latex comes from the Chico Mendes reserve, named after a conservationist and rubber tapper killed in 1988 by ranchers. The government says the condoms would be the only ones made of latex harvested from a tropical forest. Environmentalists say tapping native rubber trees helps generate income for Amazon residents and reduces pressure to fell trees. More than 550 families will earn a total of 2.2 million reais ($1.3 million) annually producing condoms, the ministry said. The intention is also to reduce Brazil's dependence on imported condoms, which are distributed free as part of a national program to combat AIDS. The government says it is the world's largest single buyer of condoms. It purchased 1 billion this year to be distributed over the next two years, a health ministry spokesman said.",

The protests, mainly involving supporters of an ousted prime minister, turned violent in April and May. Ninety people were killed and almost 2,000 wounded, raising fears for stability in Southeast Asia\'s second-biggest economy. Calm has been restored but the government says some in the "red shirt" movement may attempt to provoke further trouble. "We have been informed there are people who continue to try to spread false information to spur hatred and instigate unrest," said Ongart Klampaiboon, minister to the prime minister\'s office. Ongart, speaking after a cabinet meeting, said the state of emergency would be lifted in five provinces that have seen little political activism but would continue in Bangkok and 18 of the country\'s 76 provinces for another three months. Critics say that while the government calls for reconciliation between deeply divided political blocs, it is stifling opposition with arrests, censorship and emergency rule. Businesses, tour operators and rights groups have called for the special law to be dropped. "The government could justify it in times of violence but now that it is over, civil rights should be restored. Threats should be dealt with using normal law," Niran Pithakwatchara of the National Human Rights Commission told Reuters. The Brussels-based International Crisis Group said on Monday Thailand should lift the emergency immediately or frustration could lead to more violence. "TOO RISKY" Anti-government activists say the law is being maintained to help the military stop the opposition regrouping. "As long as the decree is in place, we cannot regroup.

       'content': 'ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court has ordered Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan to pay a symbolic fine to families of soldiers slain by Kurdish guerrillas for using a derogatory word to describe the dead men. In a statement faxed to Reuters on Friday, the office of the lawyer representing the families said Erdogan was also being fined for referring to jailed Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan as "Sayin", a term of respect meaning "esteemed". Praising a crime or criminals is an offence in Turkey. A faxed copy of the verdict, dated December 12, confirmed the ruling. The case dates back to a radio interview Erdogan gave in Australia in 2000 -- before becoming prime minister -- when he said "Sayin Ocalan" would pay for the "heads" he had taken, the statement from lawyer Kemal Kerencsiz said. The word Erdogan used for "head" was a derogatory one generally used to refer to enemy dead. The Istanbul court ordered Erdogan to pay 3 new kurus (about 2 U.S. cents) in symbolic damages to eight relatives of soldiers killed by guerrillas of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Erdogan\'s office was not immediately available for comment. "There will be thousands more such cases opened in the future. We are in touch with the families of other martyrs," Friday\'s Radikal newspaper quoted Kerencsiz as saying. Kerencsiz is a well-known ultra-nationalist who has in the past brought cases against Nobel Literatue laureate Orhan Pamuk and other authors on claims that they had insulted Turkish national identity in their writings. Ankara blames Ocalan\'s PKK for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people since the group launched its armed campaign for an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey in 1984. Ocalan himself was captured and jailed for life in 1999. (Reporting by Gareth Jones; Editing by Caroline Drees) \xc3\x82\xc2\xa9 Thomson Reuters 2011. All rights reserved.

       'content': 'By Pracha Hariraksapitak BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand\'s new government said on Tuesday it would focus on increasing people\'s income and holding down the cost of living rather than simply aim for higher economic growth through the promotion of exports. The cabinet of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra held its first full meeting on Tuesday to agree on the programme it will present to parliament, probably next week on Aug. 23 or 24. "Before, we were focusing on exports but today we have to focus on the domestic economy -- increase people\'s income and bring down their cost of living," Yingluck told reporters after the meeting. The government seems determined to push ahead with the populist programme that won it a landslide election victory on July 3, although some economists warn this could set off a wage-price spiral. Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Kittirat Na Ranong said earlier that among the priorities were a minimum wage of 300 baht ($10) a day, a starting salary for university graduates of 15,000 baht a month, a cut in company taxes, a reduction in fuel prices and a campaign against drug use. "Other governments would have insisted on economic growth, which is understandable. But what we care about most is not just growth, but increases in people\'s income, and how to distribute this higher income to everybody fairly," he told reporters before going into the meeting. The proposed nationwide minimum wage would mean an increase of 90 percent in some provinces, which is bound to hurt small businesses. These firms say they would not be helped much by an offsetting cut in corporate tax to 23 percent from 30 percent. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 FRICTION WITH CENTRAL BANK?

President Goodluck Jonathan visited the crash site in Nigeria\'s commercial hub and saw rescuers working amid the smouldering, ash-covered wreckage of the McDonnell Douglas MD-83 flown by privately owned domestic carrier Dana Air. Jonathan ordered an investigation into how the plane crashed into the iron roof of an apartment block in the residential suburb of Agege. Search teams found what they believed to be the plane\'s "black box" flight recorder, national emergency services chief Yushua Shuaibu told Reuters. Jonathan, who arrived in an armoured convoy with Lagos state governor Babatunde Fashola, got out and walked the last few metres to the crash site on foot in his traditional Nigerian kaftan and skull cap. "This particular incident is a major setback for us as a people ... Investigations will have to be done thoroughly to ascertain what was the cause of the crash," he told reporters. The airline said on Sunday 147 people had been killed but in a list published overnight there were also six crew members on board, taking the death total to 153. An unknown number of people may have been killed on the ground. An official at the airline who could not be named said the pilot was an American, Captain Peter Waxtan, and the first officer an Indian named Mike Mahendra. "They\'re still busy recovering bodies. I believe some people were killed on the land as well as on the plane, though we don\'t yet have a precise idea of numbers," said Tunji Oketunbi, a spokesman for Nigeria\'s Accident Investigation Bureau. Oke Osanyintolu, head of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, told Reuters at the scene that 80 bodies had been pulled out by about 12:30 p.m. ',

But efforts to remove the subsidy at the start of the year failed after protests and strikes forced the government to backtrack.As a result, Nigerian and foreign firms are no longer willing to supply and distribute gasoline for cash, making Nigeria wholly dependent on swaps for crude to meet its fuel needs.Nigeria\'s finance ministry cut its economic growth forecast this month to 6-7 percent in 2012, from 7-8 percent earlier, and fuel shortages could bring it down further.Protests could also erupt, as they have before over the subsidy, a highly emotive issue.Nigeria is Africa\'s biggest crude exporter, but is forced to subsidise imports of gasoline to meet the bulk of its fuel needs because it lacks refining capacity.A probe into the subsidy scheme found billions of dollars had been paid for fuel that never arrived or was resold abroad."Under the system it is impossible to make any profit if you are a small company paying interest on the subsidy money owed," said Emmanuel Ogwiji, a director at Eco-Regen, a small firm that imported gasoline last year.Despite presenting the authorities with documentation proving its activities were regular, his company had to wait half a year to be paid for the delivery.Gasoline import permits have been issued to 42 marketers this quarter, but barely any have made use of their licences, shipping records show.Instead, Nigeria has become dependent on a small pool of firms that are being',

The usually busy galleries of the Egyptian Museum, which houses the golden death mask of boy king Tutankhamun, were virtually deserted when doors opened for the first time since the early days of a revolt that ended Hosni Mubarak\'s rule. "It was very important for us to open the museum to stop the rumors like \'the mask of King Tutankhamun was stolen\' or there had been an orgy of looting ... This is a chance for visitors to see for themselves," Museum Director Tarek El Awady said. Egyptian soldiers patrolled inside the galleries. There was concern amongst Egyptologists when it became clear that some artifacts, including parts of a gilded wooden statue of Tutankhamun and a statue of Nefertiti making offerings, had been stolen during the mayhem of the revolution. The museum is situated on Cairo\'s Tahrir Square, focal point of the uprising. Army units secured the museum on January 28 after a day of violence when looters ran amok damaging artifacts. Some of the robbers ransacked the gift shop, mistaking it for the museum. At one point Mubarak supporters threw petrol bombs that exploded close by. "NO PLAN B" "The tour operators said it was safe for us to go, so we gambled. We didn\'t know the museum would be open," said Dutch tourist Sandra de Rooij, a supermarket worker. Despite warnings from some travel agencies about unrest, tourists from the Netherlands, Canada and Japan said their curiosity to see the new Egypt had overcome any fears. "It is a fine moment for Egypt, and I feel absolutely safe here ... the sound of freedom lulled me to sleep," said Canadian tourist Barbara Bonkowsky, who said she had cried for joy when Mubarak stepped down.

       'content': 'By Azad Majumder DHAKA (Reuters Life!) - Shamsunnahar Hena, a gynecologist in a Bangladesh hospital, was stunned when her pregnant patient confessed to having eaten half a kilogram of soil every day since she conceived. A rising number of pregnant woman in Bangladesh\'s tea-growing Sylhet region are eating charred soil, following a tradition that is meant to stimulate their appetite, which in turn will boost their health and that of their unborn child. But physicians say the soil-eating trend is dangerous. "Often we get pregnant women complaining of dysentery and some other problems (but) in most cases they are found guilty of eating soil," Hena told Reuters over telephone from Bangladesh\'s northeastern Sylhet city. The habit has opened up a way of living for many poor and jobless people, who collect and burn pieces of mud and sell them at markets at up to 120 taka ($1.75) a kg. "Normally they eat a piece or two in a day, but recently I got a patient who confessed to eating half a kilogram of soil every day during her pregnancy period," said Hena, the chief gynecologist in Sylhet\'s Osmani Medical College. "I was simply shocked." Vendors collect the soil from hills and scorch it before shaping it into pieces for sale, local residents said. "Usually the husbands or father-in-laws of the expecting women buy the soil for their wives. The markets sit through the day, from dawn to dusk," said Mainul Bulbul, a local journalist. Officials are puzzled by how popular the habit has become, especially given that Bangladeshi women in general are increasingly aware of health issues, as more of them attend school and work outside their homes. "But it could land them is serious problems, as medical science never supported that idea but instead says eating soil would reduce their hunger and sometimes causes infection," Hena said.

The bear is one of four 50 kg (110 lb) endangered Asiatic black cubs and two adults that were smuggled either from neighboring Laos or from southern Vietnam in the past seven months, and confiscated by the authorities. They are now under the care of forestry authorities and international wildlife veterinarians at the Vietnam Bear Rescue Center in Tam Dao National Park, 70km (44 miles) north of Hanoi, which will eventually house 100 bears. "It reaches across to people, acknowledging that we should be protecting bears for their own sake rather than how they can be benefiting humankind," said Jill Robinson, founder of Animals Asia Foundation, a Hong Kong-based animal welfare charity that is funding the bear rescue center. "I think that\'s a very good message that we don\'t need bears today in traditional Chinese medicine," she said at Monday\'s opening of a quarantine area for bears, the first phase of the project in the green, forested hills of the park. "There are lots of herbal alternatives and synthetic alternatives too." It is illegal in Vietnam to extract the bile from bears or to advertise the trade, yet authorities and wildlife groups estimate more than 4,000 "Moon Bears" as they are known for the white crescent mark on their chest, are caged and mistreated in farms across the country.

       'content': 'MANILA, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Philippine corporations and government agencies signed an integrity pledge on Wednesday, seeking to stop corruption and tax evasion as part of efforts to improve the business environment in the poor Southeast Asian nation. About 700 companies signed the pledge to promote and adhere to ethical and business standards, including leading conglomerates Ayala Corp and JG Summit Holdings . The Philippines ranked 134th out of 178 countries in Transparency International\'s 2010 corruption perception index, and pervasive corruption is repeatedly cited as a major obstacle to investment and economic development. President Benigno Aquino said signing the pledge alone was not be enough to stop corruption, urging business executives to pay the correct taxes. "In the past, perhaps you could have justified not paying taxes by saying it would have been used to fatten the wallets of corrupt officials," he told a summit organised by the Makati Business Club and the European Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines. "But as we strive to show you that that is no longer the case, I hope we can urge our fellow citizens to pay their share of taxes. I urge you to stand alongside us and do your part." Tax evasion has cut government revenues, hampering the ability to upgrade infrastructure and fund social spending. Through enforcement of existing laws, the government wants to raise revenues to 17 percent of GDP from 14.6 percent in 2009. Among those signing the pledge were local units of foreign firms such as Nestle and Siemens (SIEGn.DE: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz). Ramon del Rosario, head of the influential Makati Business Club, said another 300 firms had expressed interest in signing the pledge.

       'content': 'Exclusive - India to ask airlines to shun EU carbon scheme By Anurag Kotoky NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is poised to ask airlines not to take part in the European Union emissions trading scheme, a senior official said, in what would be an escalation of a row over the EU\'s unilateral move to charge for carbon emitted by flights in and out of Europe. China in February barred its airlines from participating in the European scheme, which is meant to reduce emissions. The Indian official, with direct knowledge of talks between the EU and other countries on the issue, told Reuters that India will soon ask local airlines not to share emissions data with the bloc or buy any carbon credits. If the EU retaliates by suspending Indian airlines from flying to Europe, India would make similar moves and consider charging an "unreasonable" amount for flying over India, the official said on Monday. "We have lots of measures to take if the EU does not go back on its demands. We have the power of the economy, we are not bleeding as they are," the government official said, adding that Europe\'s position would harm its own economy and airlines. Indian government is awaiting formal approvals from several ministries to implement the order to airlines, which it expects soon, the official said. "The questions is, are you EU.L provoking the world into a trade war?" the official said. Last week, China suspended the purchase of 10 more Airbus (EAD.PA: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) jets, raising the stakes in the trade row over European Union airline emissions charges. India does not yet plan to ask airlines to cancel Airbus purchases, but that is a possibility if the dispute escalates, the Indian official said. Amber Dubey, director for aviation at global consultancy KPMG, said India is in the midst of a huge increase in the size of both its civilian and defence fleets, with a significant share of the orders coming from European suppliers.

Media rights groups have accused Addis Ababa of using national security concerns as an excuse to clamp down on opposition figures and journalists, a charge dismissed by the government. Both the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Amnesty International criticized the convictions. "This is a dark day for justice in Ethiopia, where freedom of expression is being systematically destroyed by a government targeting any dissenting voice," said Amnesty International\'s Ethiopia researcher Claire Beston. Journalist and blogger Eskinder Nega was arrested last year and accused of trying to incite violence with a series of online articles, alongside other charges. Along with the 23 other named individuals, he was also accused of belonging to Ginbot 7, a group branded a "terrorist" organization by the Ethiopian government. The 24 were charged last year, most of them in absentia, with six counts including conspiracy to dismantle the constitutional order, recruitment and training for terror acts and aiding Ethiopia\'s arch-foe Eritrea and a rebel group to disrupt security. Only Nega and seven other defendants were in court on Wednesday when judge Endeshaw Adane dismissed charges of espionage and participation in terror acts. The rest were abroad and convicted in absentia. Adane said the defendants\' main aim was to spark an "Arab Spring"-style revolt in the country. "Under the guise of freedom of speech and gathering, the suspects attempted to incite violence and overthrow the constitutional order," he said before delivering the verdict.

She earns about $100 a month washing clothes and her husband used to bring in about $70 a month driving a motorcycle taxi until he went blind. But things are better than they used to be. Through a program in the Philippines called Pantawid Pamilya (Family Subsistence), 3 million poor households like Capco\'s get small grants from the government if they keep their children in school and take them regularly to health centers. "It\'s really a big help because now we don\'t have a problem about whether we can have food to eat or if the kids have money to go to school," Capco, 43, said with her two-year-old daughter Rihanna in her lap. A high school graduate with gleaming eyes and a ready smile, Capco has been in the ramshackle community for 18 years. None of her neighbors has a steady job. With a quarter of its people below the poverty line as the population crests 100 million, the Philippines points to the need for developing Asia to reverse worsening inequality and broaden the benefits of the region\'s tremendous economic growth. Conditional Cash Transfer schemes like Pantawid Pamilya - so named for the conditions imposed to qualify for benefits - were pioneered in\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Brazil\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and Mexico and have proven very effective in giving immediate help to the poor and breaking vicious cycles of poverty by improving health, education and opportunities. Narrowing the wealth gap has become as pressing as poverty alleviation, making it a key theme of this week\'s annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Manila with government officials, bankers and civil society groups from 67 countries.

       'content': 'Teenage gunman kills 15 in German school attack By Hendrik Sackmann and Nicola Leske WINNENDEN, Germany (Reuters) - A 17-year-old in black combat gear killed 15 people in southwest Germany on Wednesday in a shooting spree that started at his former school. The gunman, identified by police as Tim Kretschmer, entered the school in the town of Winnenden at about 9.30 a.m. and began firing with a 9-mm Beretta pistol at students in a classroom. He killed nine students, including eight teenage girls, and three women teachers, as well as one person in front of a clinic opposite the school, before fleeing with a hostage in a car hijacked at a local supermarket. Police said most of the victims at the Albertville- Realschule had been shot in the head and a further seven pupils, all female, were injured. The gunman died hours later in a shoot-out in Wendlingen, some 30 km (20 miles) from the school, after killing two men in a car dealership. Those killings brought the death toll to 16, including the gunman, who police believe shot himself. "Nobody can understand it," said Roberto Seifert, who works near the school. "Everyone is in shock." Chancellor Angela Merkel called it a day of mourning for all of Germany. "It is unimaginable that in just seconds, pupils and teachers were killed -- it is an appalling crime," she told reporters in Berlin. The local church held a candlelight service to remember the victims. About half the 1,000 people there had to stand and many wept and hugged each other during the service. Germany has strict laws which require gun-holders to fulfill criteria on age and weapons expertise to obtain a firearms license. Police said the gunman had apparently used a gun registered to his father, who belongs to a shooting club and had a collection of 15 guns at home. The killer took the one gun that was not locked up, but kept in his father\'s bedroom. Large amounts of ammunition were also missing from the family home.

Only he can end this pain."There were fewer than usual at churches in the capital Abuja, which sits in the centre of the country where the largely Muslim north and mostly Christian south meet.But hundreds still queued to pass through military checkpoints outside the largest churches in Abuja, and hundreds of thousands of worshippers around the country were determined to attend regardless of the risks."They will always tell you that they would prefer to die in the house of God than dying in nightclubs or dying in the streets," said Franklin Okoye, president of a church society in Abuja.Religion plays a key role for almost everyone in Africa\'s most populous nation, where "Thank God" and "Inshallah" are as common greetings as "hello" or "how are you?"The escalating violence has raised fears of wider sectarian conflict in Africa\'s top oil producer, which is reeling from',

President Dmitry Medvedev vowed to track down and punish those behind the bombing, which also injured over 150 people, during the busy late afternoon at Moscow\'s Domodedovo airport. The dead included some foreigners. Islamist rebels have vowed to take their bombing campaign from the North Caucasus to the Russian heartland in the year before presidential elections, hitting transport and economic targets. They have also leveled threats at the 2014 Winter\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Olympics, scheduled for the Black Sea resort town of Sochi, a region some militants consider "occupied." Dense smoke filled Domodedovo\'s international arrivals hall and a fire burned along one wall. "Taxi drivers lined up in the arrivals hall were blown up. Pieces of their bodies covered us and my left ear doesn\'t hear very well at all," Artyom Zhilenkov, 30, told Reuters as he pointed to pieces of human flesh on his coat. Thick drops of blood were scattered across the snow-covered tarmac outside the arrivals hall, where Interfax news agency said traces of shrapnel were found. Two Britons were among the dead, media cited investigative committee spokesman Vladimir Markin as saying, and French, Italians, and Germans were in hospitals, though this could not be immediately confirmed with their embassies. Planes from across Europe had landed in the half hour leading up to the attack. "I heard a loud boom... we thought someone had just dropped something. But then I saw casualties being carried away," a check-in attendant who gave her name as Elena told Reuters at Domodedovo, which is some 22 km (14 miles) southeast of Moscow.

       'content': 'By Alexei Anishchuk MOSCOW (Reuters) - There was no risk of a radiation leak after a fire broke out at a Moscow nuclear research centre housing a non-operational 60-year-old atomic reactor on Sunday, said officials, but Greenpeace Russia expressed serious concern about the incident. The fire broke out early on Sunday in a part of the Alikhanov Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics in southwestern Moscow that contains a research collider, institute officials said in a statement on its website. There were no radiation sources in the area of the collider, which had been shut off on December 25, and no danger of a radiation leak, the statement said. It said personnel were evacuated and nobody was hurt. Grey smoke rose above the institute, which is encircled by a wall, and an acrid smell filled the air. Some 30 emergency vehicles, including fire trucks and ambulances, stood inside and outside the main gate, witnesses said. Several phone calls to the institute went unanswered. The fire was in a basement area, said Sergei Vlasov, spokesman for the Moscow branch of the Emergencies Ministry. Sergei Novikov, spokesman for Russia\'s state nuclear agency Rosatom, said there were no open flames, only smoke that came from an area housing power cables and could not affect any nuclear materials at the institute. "This case poses no threat to fissile materials," said Novikov, adding firefighters were pumping foam into the affected area. He said the institute\'s heavy-water research reactor was no longer operational. SAFETY CONCERNS A Greenpeace Russia official said the incident was potentially very dangerous. "This is extremely dangerous ... this should not have happened at all, but as long as it did, it shows there has been a major failure in their operations," said Ivan Blokov, campaign director at Greenpeace Russia.

       'content': 'By Azad Majumder DHAKA (Reuters Life!) - Mohammad Raju ran away from his poor family in Bangladesh\'s southern Khulna district eight years ago, hoping for a better life in the capital, Dhaka. Instead, his life got worse. His tiny income from selling chocolates in the sprawling parliament compound in Dhaka left him hungry and homeless. "I used to earn up to 20 taka ($0.30) in a day which was in no way enough to survive. Sometimes policemen, who were on duty at the parliament compound, gave me their spare food. Still I spent many days with little or no food," Raju told Reuters. Raju\'s life changed after he discovered an unlikely profession for a street child: banking. The 16-year-old boy started working for the Children\'s Development Bank, a Bangladesh-based lender that is owned by a non-government organization and managed by street children. He now earns 2,000 taka ($30) a month and can save a portion of his income. His workplace looks like any other Bangladesh bank, with counters and a cash and ledger book -- except for the fact that the bank clerks are unusually young. Raju has been promoted to the post of program assistant at the bank and is now a paid employee, working under an adult supervisor. But most of the children who work here are volunteers wanting to learn new skills and contribute to a system that allows them to save money and earn some interest on their savings. Others simply deposit their money at the bank, which is open two hours a day, without becoming involved as volunteers. NO PICK-POCKETS "Often they spoil the money earned through hard labor by taking drugs or watching movies. Our bank keeps it safe for their future," said Basudeb Maitra, coordinator of the Children\'s Development Bank.

Two attacks took place in the villages of Nakatete and Kitumba in the Fizi area of South Kivu province from January 19 to January 21, Charline Burton, a spokeswoman for the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told Reuters. International health organisation Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) treated 60 people, including men, women and children, who said they had been raped in the attacks, she said. "The humanitarian actors have been on the ground only very recently, so it is too soon to know who did this. But we should know more in the coming days," she said. Several armed groups operate in eastern Congo since a 1998-2003 war that killed five million people in the central African state, and sexual violence has become common. "This is no longer a crisis, its becoming a culture," said Nene Rukunghu, a doctor working at the Panzi hospital which specialises in helping rape victims. She said rapes by civilians appeared to be on the rise, adding: "People ask, \'why do the rebels come and rape us?\' And they start to think it makes them strong so they copy them." The UN\'s special representative on sexual violence last year called eastern Congo the rape capital of the world, a label the government has strongly rejected. Last year, fighters from the Rwandan Hutu extremist group FDLR were suspected to be behind the rapes of more than three hundred women in Walikale, North Kivu, over the span of several days. Earlier this month Congolese soldiers were accused of raping 67 people in the town of Fizi. Those attacks caused an international outcry over the level of sexual violence in the region, where more than one hundred and sixty women are raped each month in North and South Kivu, according to UN figures.

       'content': 'By Mohammad Nurul Islam SAINT MARTIN, Bangladesh (Reuters Life!) - Corals and clear blue water have helped Bangladesh\'s only coral island become a major tourist attraction -- just don\'t expect a buzzing nightlife. While mainly Muslim Bangladesh has tried to encourage tourism, it still bans discotheques, night clubs and bars that serve alcohol. Tour operators even lament the scarcity of golf clubs in the country of more than 140 million people. Nevertheless, Saint Martin in the Bay of Bengal attracts thousands of local and foreign visitors every day thanks to its panoramic beauty and pristine marine life. About 14 km off Bangladesh\'s southernmost town of Teknaf, the island\'s beaches are fringed with coconut palms. "It\'s a paradise for us," said Nahreen Akhtar, a mother of two, who works for a private bank in Dhaka and was holidaying in the island. Five or ten years ago, fewer than 200 people dared to cross the choppy sea every day to land on the island. They mostly returned before nightfall. Now, more than 3,000 tourists, mostly Bangladeshis, arrive every day and tend to stay overnight. "I enjoy bringing people here and they are pleasantly surprised when they see all the beauty. It\'s a shame this is not more known to the world yet," said Filip Engsig-Karup, a Danish tour operator. "When I take people from Denmark to Bangladesh, everybody is amazed because the impression they have got about this country is quite different from the reality," he said. The tiny island is locally known as Narikel Jinjira (Coconut Island). During high tide, tourist can walk around the whole island in a day. Local authorities recently introduced scuba diving and speedboat sailing in a bid to attract more tourists, and there are plans to bring water skiing and other sporting facilities to the island. Chera Dwip, another coral paradise which forms part of Saint Martin when the tide is low, can be reached on foot, though the walk takes 2.5 hours and tourists usually prefer to go by boat. "Bang',

       'content': 'By Olivia Rondonuwu JAKARTA (Reuters) - An Indonesian court convicted on Wednesday a former relationship manager with Citibank of money laundering in a case involving Ferraris bought with ill-gotten cash that powered the lifestyles of a glamour-hungry clique. A district court in South Jakarta sentenced Inong Malinda Dee, 49, to eight years in prison and a 10 billion rupiah fine in a measure of the seriousness of a crackdown on endemic corruption in Southeast Asia\'s largest economy. The case shook up Indonesia\'s investment banking industry and prompted regulators to ban the bank from adding new clients to its wealth management business for a year from last May. Dee ordered 117 transfers each worth up to 2 billion rupiah ($223,000) from her Citigold clients\' accounts to her or acquaintances between 2007 and 2011, prosecutors said during her trial. The money was spent on cars by Ferrari, Porsche, Mercedes and Hummer as well on as apartments and houses, prosecutors said. The court on Wednesday ordered two Ferraris, one Hummer and a Toyota 4x4 to be returned to Citibank as well as 1.6 billion Indonesian rupiah ($175,100) in cash. "The defendant\'s crime ran contrary to the government\'s program of eradicating money laundering, which is a law enforcement priority," said Judge Kusno in a prepared verdict statement read in court. Dee, who wore a black chiffon head scarf and pink stilettos in court, appeared tearful as she was driven away from a packed courtroom to begin her sentence. Her case has caused a stir in a country that is creating millionaires faster than any other Asian nation, according to Julius Baer, and she has drawn media attention because of her glamorous lifestyle. Citi, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, ordered an internal investigation after one of its wealthy clients noticed unauthorized transfers and reported them. Dee was arrested by police last March. The case led the central bank to launch an investigation into banks\' risk management systems and s',

The shootout occurred when three federal officers approached the two suspects in the airport's Terminal 2, which handles international and domestic flights. Two agents were killed at the terminal and another later died of his injuries in the hospital. More than a dozen shots were heard, Milenio Television reported. Television footage showed a body lying on the floor of the terminal in what appeared to be a publicly accessible area of the airport. The suspects, who remain at large, are believed to be part of a larger group of officials involved in a cocaine ring, Mexico's security ministry said in a statement. Airport spokesman Jorge Gomez told Milenio that aircraft departures and arrivals continued normally after the incident. Mexico City has seen relatively low murder rates compared to the rest of the country, where drug violence has killed around 55,000 people in the past five and half years. But attacks have been creeping up in the capital and its surrounding neighborhoods, with more than 300 gangland killings recorded last year. Mexico's airports and ports are busy areas for drug smugglers. So far this year federal police have seized more than 440 pounds (200 kilograms) of cocaine at the capital's airport, double the amount taken there last year.

"The former president was sitting in a reclining position on her bed when her fingerprints and pictures were taken," Senior Superintendent Joel Coronel, head of the national police\'s criminal investigation and detection group, told reporters outside St. Luke\'s hospital. "She was wearing a hospital gown and a neck brace but was responding to queries from our medical team. An intravenous fluid is hydrating her," he said. A police officer took Arroyo\'s mugshots, Coronel said. He declined to release copies of the photographs, saying they would be reported to a lower court that issued an arrest warrant Friday that stopped her from leaving the country. Arroyo, elected into the lower house of Congress last year, was scheduled to fly to Singapore after the Supreme Court upheld its earlier suspension of the government\'s travel ban on her and her husband. Her arrest comes 18 months after President Benigno Aquino won an election by vowing to fight corruption and prosecuting those responsible, and particularly pursue Arroyo. The former leader\'s legal spokesman, Raul Lambino, said they will question the lower court\'s jurisdiction to handle the electoral sabotage charges against Arroyo when they appear before the Pasay City regional trial court Monday. "The process was not only railroaded and the Pasay City court is the not right venue to hear the complaint," Lambino told Reuters, saying the arrest warrant against Arroyo could be quashed if the lower court loses jurisdiction over the case. Arroyo says she needs to travel to seek medical treatment for a spine condition, but the government believes she wants to evade investigation and possible prosecution.

The website said Altunc was killed and the others were wounded during a firefight between the PKK and Turkish soldiers. Separately, PKK rebels kidnapped a village leader and five other members of a state-backed militia after stopping their vehicles at a road block in Bitlis province late on Friday, the sources said. The PKK takes control of roads in parts of the mainly Kurdish southeast at night when the army returns to its bases. The autonomy-seeking PKK has waged an armed campaign against the Turkish army since 1984, and more than 40,000 people, mainly Kurds, have been killed in the conflict. Violence typically picks up in the warmer spring months in the southeast, when PKK fighters are able to more easily cross mountain passes from northern Iraq, where they are based.

Ethiopian government spokesman Shimeles Kemal told Reuters Heinlein was arrested after failing to identify himself to police and officials. Groups of Muslims have been holding protests in Ethiopia accusing the government of interfering in religious affairs by promoting an Islamic movement that opposes ultra-conservative ideology and rejects violence. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has said he is concerned about signs of growing "extremism" in the country. Media watchdogs have accused Addis Ababa of using national security as an excuse to crack down on its press - a charge the government dismisses. Critics point to a 2009 law under which anyone convicted of publishing information that could induce readers to commit acts of terrorism could be jailed for up to 20 years. More than 10 journalists have been charged under the law, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Earlier this year, two Swedish journalists were sentenced to 11 years in jail for entering the country illegally and aiding a rebel group. The two have sought clemency rather than appeal, which they hope will lead to a quicker release.

Some TV stations, citing police, said up to 20 people could have been killed in the accident. The impact of the collision left a couple of compartments of the trains mangled, and rescue workers had to use gas-cutting machines to tear through to reach passengers trapped inside. Local police officer Raj Narayan Shukla told Reuters they had pulled out 10 bodies and that the toll could go up once they managed to cut through into all affected compartments. "There are some who have been seriously injured," Shukla said. The accident occurred when a speeding Goa Sampark Kranti Express rammed into the Mewar Express waiting near the Mathura city station. Both trains were headed to New Delhi. It was not immediately clear how the two trains came on to the same tracks. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa9 Thomson Reuters 2011. All rights reserved.

"P&G is anticipating the need for 200,000 tonnes of fatty alcohol in the coming ten years from Indonesia," Hidayat said following a meeting with P&G officials at his office. "To meet the need they are preparing at least $100 million to set up a joint venture with the local partner in the sector," Hidayat added. High commodity prices and government efforts to boost downstream industries have started to attract investment in Indonesia over the past year. Indonesia plans to offer fiscal incentives and restructure its export tax policy on crude palm oil, after it steadily hiked the tax to 25 percent in February from just 3 percent a year ago, to do more to spur downstream processing in the country. The country is still reliant on exports of raw materials, and is aiming to move up the value chain. Agriculture companies are looking to take advantage of growing wealth within Southeast Asia\'s biggest economy. Indonesia\'s economy grew by 6.5 percent in the first quarter of 2011 from a year earlier, data showed in early May, due in part to strong domestic consumption.

The Horn of Africa nation has long suffered from one of the world\'s highest death rates of children due to recurring droughts. Twenty years ago the mortality rate for those aged under five was about 20 percent. "Today, according to the 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey, that figure has been slashed by more than half to 8.8 per cent," said Keseteberhan Admassu, Ethiopia\'s State Minister of Health. "Reducing malnutrition, which is an underlying factor in at least half of all under-five deaths, has had a profound impact on the survival rates of children," he told a gathering of representatives of United Nations agencies. Keseteberhan said the nation-wide malnutrition rate has been slashed by 32 percent, with prevalence to being underweight dropping to 28.7 percent in 2010 from 42.1 percent in 2000. The U.N. Children\'s Fund (UNICEF) attributed the reductions to increased access to health posts in remote and drought-stricken areas, and a growing number of health workers. The number of health posts has surged to more than 9,000 in 2011 from a handful in 2004 with priority shifted towards food-insecure areas, UNICEF said. "The vigorous training of health extension workers who are on the frontline in the work to provide integrated health, nutrition, sanitation and hygiene services to rural communities ... has paid off," said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF\'s representative to Ethiopia. Across the Horn of Africa, a fierce drought is forcing more than 13 million people to rely on emergency food aid this year, according to aid agencies. Some 3.7 million Somalis are at risk of s',

It was fretting about speed. "We wanted to innovate fast. This is the first end-to-end hardware product that Google has ever put out," said John Lagerling, Google\'s senior director of Android global partnerships. The cost of building the orb-shaped Nexus Q, a cross between a streaming video box like Apple TV and a stereo amplifier, "was not the No. 1 priority," Lagerling said. "We wanted to see if we could do fast (design iterations) rather than having our engineers fly across the world." "This is not this big initiative that things had to be made in the USA," he said. Google\'s decision to go with a local manufacturer is a striking departure from the made-in-China model that Apple Inc and other consumer electronics manufacturers have long considered essential to their competitiveness. Google\'s move reflects a nascent trend of "reshoring" manufacturing operations to the United States. While such actions are largely driven by soaring labor costs in China, other benefits of manufacturing locally are shorter lead times, more responsive partners and better protection of intellectual property. The Nexus Q will also likely sell in limited quantities, which made finding the cheapest possible manufacturer less important. BGC analyst Colin Gillis said Google would probably not sell more than 100,000 of the devices, which he said are pricey compared with products like Apple\'s set-top box.

       'content': '* Plans to expand arabica area to 40,000 hectares * Says will double output of aromatic bean to 96,000 T * Cheaper robusta currently accounts for 97 pct of coffee output By Ho Binh Minh HANOI, July 26 (Reuters) - Vietnam, already the world\'s biggest producer of robusta coffee, plans to expand its planting area for arabica in a bid to more than double output of the superior-quality bean to 96,000 tonnes by 2020, though industry officials said production could be even higher. The Southeast Asian nation, the world\'s No.2 coffee producer after Brazil, will expand its northern and central arabica area to 40,000 hectares (99,000 acres) over the next eight years, an Agriculture Ministry official said. Estimates on Vietnam\'s current arabica area range from 32,000 to 38,000 hectares, though it has no central agency able to give exact crop data. "We aim to keep the area stable at (40,000 hectares) until 2030," Pham Van Thanh, a manager in the ministry\'s crops department, told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference. Arabica coffee requires wet processing to ensure the higher quality of its beans, something many domestic processors have yet to embrace due to limited funding and unstable domestic supplies, some officials said. The government said in a plan seen by Reuters that output of arabica would rise to 96,000 tonnes by 2020, accounting for 9 percent of the country\'s total coffee output that year. It did not say how much would be invested in the expansion. But Thai Hoa Vietnam Group, Vietnam\'s top exporter of arabica, said the country was more likely to be producing 120,000-150,000 tonnes of the variety by 2020. Vietnam\'s arabica output in the next 2012/2013 crop year will rise 12 percent from the current season to between 55,000 and 57,000 tonnes, or 917,000-950,000 bags, Thai Hoa Vietnam Chairman Nguyen Van An said earlier this month. The country could replace robusta with arabica in some areas with a suitable climate, Vietnam Coffee and Cocoa Association Chai',

Virgin Group confirmed it was having "preliminary discussions" with various parties in Turkey but declined to comment further. Turkcell said it was open to partnerships in the field but gave no further details. Virtual operators do not own the networks they use to provide communications services. "Virgin Mobile wants to become a mobile virtual network operator in Turkey, so they have been talking to companies in the market. They have reached a certain level in talks with Turkcell," one source close to the matter told Reuters. At 75 million and growing, Turkey\'s population is set to overtake Germany\'s, currently the largest in the European Union, by 2025. Per capita income has nearly tripled over the past decade, though the crisis in Europe has slowed growth this year. Its mobile penetration was 88.5 percent at the end of June with subscribers numbering 66.14 million, according to data from the market regulator. The rate is much lower than in European Union countries, where it can be as high as 170 percent. "We continue to look at new opportunities across Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Turkey is one of those markets we are analysing and we are having some preliminary discussions with various parties," said Nick Fox, director of financial communications for Virgin Group. "We feel Turkey would be a great Virgin Mobile market." There are currently three mobile phone operators in Turkey: Turkcell, Vodafone Turkey, and Turk Telekom unit Avea.

The two countries will cooperate in research, student exchanges and joint laboratories, and in the fields of information technology, engineering, biotechnology, renewable energy, the environment, sustainable development of agriculture and food technology, the Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA) reported. ILNA said the agreement was signed by Iran\'s Minister for Science, Research, and Technology Farhad Daneshjoo and North Korean Foreign Minister Pak Ui-chun. North Korea has had close ties with Iran. Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables from 2010 showed that U.S. officials believe Iran has acquired ballistic missile parts from North Korea.

       'content': 'Sept 5 (Reuters) - Indonesian badminton doubles pair Greysia Polii and Meiliana Jauhari have been hit with a four-month ban for their role in a match-throwing scandal at the London Olympics. The Indonesian pair, along with four players from South Korea and two from China, were kicked out of the Games in August for deliberately trying to lose matches. Amid farcical scenes, the players served into the net and missed easy shots in an attempt to lose their games and gain favourable draws in the knockout stages. "After studying and listening to all sides, the sanction will be applied from the date of the incident until Dec. 3," national association (PSBI) secretary general Yacob Rusdianto told the local Antara news agency on Tuesday. "With all due respect, we suffer losses (in this decision) but it should be understood that the sanction should be given because they violated rules of fair play. The Badminton World Federation has declared them guilty. "Hopefully this could be accepted by all sides, don\'t keep on delaying the sanction, have pity on the athletes," he added. "There will always be pros and cons, there will be people who say it\'s too light or too heavy." The four South Korean players booted out of the Games were initially given two-year bans which were cut to six months, while coach Sung Han-kook has had a lifetime suspension cut to two years. Chinese player Yu Yang announced her retirement from the sport in the fallout from the scandal.

"India will have the highest passenger traffic growth in the world, higher than even China\'s in the next 20 years," Dinesh Keskar, Boeing\'s senior vice president for Asia Pacific and India, told reporters. Boeing (BA.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) officials forecast passenger traffic to grow by 8.4 percent annually in South Asia, which includes India, and by 7 percent annually in China up to 2031. Boeing and its European rival, Airbus (EAD.PA: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), are locked in a global contest for passenger plane market share and in some cases have resorted to halving prices to bolster orders of newly revamped models of their best-selling narrowbody jets. India, one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world, offers tremendous growth opportunities to planemakers as more newly affluent Indians take to the skies. However, the Indian market has slowed recently. India\'s domestic air traffic fell 1.1 percent in July compared to a year ago, the worst performance for any market globally, according to the International Air Transport Association, an industry body representing more than 80 percent of global air traffic. India\'s airlines are struggling with surging oil prices, high sales taxes on jet fuel and fierce competition that has resulted in cutthroat pricing, leading to massive losses. Boeing has also lost several deals in Asia to Airbus recently, including a $7 billion order from Philippine Airlines Inc , despite massive U.S. lobbying on behalf of Boeing. Boeing has been waiting for months to deliver the first of 27 Dreamliners ordered by state-owned Air India, but the deal has been delayed by more than four years as Air India and Boeing fought over how m',

       'content': 'By Nastassia Astrasheuskaya MOSCOW (Reuters) - Scientists who found well preserved woolly mammoth remains in a remote part of Russia hope they might contain the necessary material to clone the long extinct beast. The Russian-led international team found the remains, including fur and bone marrow, with some cell nuclei intact, in the Ust-Yansk area of the Yakutia region on Russia\'s Arctic coast. The next step will be to search for living cells among the material which was preserved in the Siberian permafrost, said the Russian scientist who led the expedition with members from the United States, Canada, South Korea, Sweden and Great Britain. "All we need for cloning is one living cell, which means it can reproduce autonomously. Then it will be no problem for us to multiply them to tens of thousands cells," said Semyon Grigoryev, a professor at North-East Federal University (NEFU). However, media reports that the scientists were close to making a "Jurassic Park"-style breakthrough by bringing the giant mammal back to life after thousands of years of extinction, were exaggerated. "We are counting on our region\'s permafrost to have kept some cells alive. But it is unlikely," said Grigoryev, pointing out that the remains would need to have been at a stable temperature between -4 and -20 Celsius (between 28 and -4 Fahrenheit) for any cells to remain alive. Some media had reported that living cells had been discovered, but Grigoryev said that had been due to a translation error as the word "intact" had been translated from English into Russian as "living". "What we have found are intact cells, with a whole nucleus," he said, adding that living cells, if found, would provide the necessary samples to make a living clone. The Yana 2012 expedition found the remains last week at the depth of 5-6 metres (16-20 feet) in a tunnel dug by locals searching for rare and valuable mammoth bone. A previous find, discovered in the same region two years ago, yielded the remains of a 40,000-',

       'content': 'By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Kaori Kaneko TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan\'s industrial output unexpectedly fell as factories cut output to key Chinese and European markets while a leading indicator for manufacturing hovered at its lowest in 16 months, in a sign that the economy could contract in the third quarter. Industrial output dropped 1.2 percent in July compared with a median estimate for a 1.7 percent increase in a Reuters poll and followed a 0.4 percent gain in June. In a further sign of trouble ahead, the purchasing managers index for August showed manufacturing activity contracted for a third straight month as domestic and external demand suffer. Manufacturers said they expect output to rise only modestly in August and then fall again in September, which could increase the chance that the economy will contract in the third quarter and pressure policymakers to bolster growth. "Exports to China and the European Union have been decreasing, so electronics parts makers are cutting back on production to adjust inventories," said Seiji Adachi, senior economist at Deutsche Securities. "Forecasts for August and September show that output is on a downtrend." Asia\'s other major exporters are also feeling the pinch from the global slowdown. South Korea\'s factory output, which closely tracks exports of smartphones, cars, machinery and ships, fell a larger-than-expected 1.6 percent in July. The yen showed little response to the surprisingly weak industrial output and PMI data. The downbeat data sent the benchmark 10-year JGB futures contract to a two-week high and it stayed near that level in later trade. "The Bank of Japan has to downgrade quite considerably their economic outlook going forward, given these figures, and I think this will put them in a very tight spot because they\'ve already promised a 1 percent inflation rate," said Shogo Fujita, chief Japan bond strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

The air is thick with illicit smoke and shots of hard liquor are being passed around. Couples cuddle and kiss in a lounge. This is not Saturday night at a club in New York, London or Paris. It is the secret side of Pakistan, a Muslim nation often described in the West as a land of bearded, Islamic hardmen and repressed, veiled women. Pakistan was created out of Muslim-majority areas in colonial India 65 years ago, and for decades portrayed itself as a progressive Islamic nation. Starting in the 1980s, however, it has been drifting towards a more conservative interpretation of Islam that has reshaped the political landscape, fuelled militancy and cowed champions of tolerance into silence. But the country remains home to a large wealthy and Westernised elite that, in private, lives very differently. Every weekend, fashion designers, photographers, medical students and businessmen gather at dozens of parties in Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore to push social boundaries in discreet surroundings that would horrify, and enrage, advocates of the stricter brand of Islam. "This is just epic," said Numair Shahzada, bobbing his head to the beat at a party in a farmhouse outside Islamabad as fitness instructors moonlighting as bouncers looked on. "The light and smoke show is phenomenal." Young men and women mix freely, dancing, talking or drinking. Some curl up together in quiet areas. Although alcohol is prohibited in the country, many have brought their own liquor. Whisky is carried in paper bags and vodka is disguised in water bottles arranged along the dance floor.

In Soviet times, the 15,000 hectare farm, in Russia\'s Black Sea breadbasket region of Krasnodar, would deliver its wheat to the local elevator for shipping inland to make bread. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 the farm has turned itself into a 1 billion rouble ($30.93 million) per year business producing wheat, fruit, sausages and sugar. It sells its 45,000-50,000 tonnes of high-quality milling wheat at the farm gate to be shipped to consumers such as Turkey. It is emblematic of a Russian agriculture industry that is trying to establish itself as a force on world markets. With the world\'s fourth largest acreage of arable land and few constraints on fresh water supplies, Russia wants to use its natural wealth to spur the economy. It was Soviet dictator Josef Stalin\'s determination to force the peasantry to give up its grain that launched collectivization on these lands nearly 80 years ago, the town\'s Bible seized, its church razed and its people left to starve. State quotas still governed life on the farm when Yuri Kharaman, a wiry man in his late 50s with a permanent sunburn from life in the fields, took over as the collective\'s chairman. "We don\'t have that pressure anymore. We can focus on profit per hectare," said Kharaman, who drives a sport utility vehicle and, like other members of the collective, owns a five-hectare share of the farm\'s land near the town of Staroshcherbinovskaya, on the road to the port of Yeisk. Russia\'s farm industry is shaking off the malaise that followed the Soviet collapse. But the country is battling drought as it tries to reclaim its place as a top world exporter, one it held before the 1917 Russian Revolution. The drought has cut this year\'s harvest by nearly ',

Also on Friday, Fitch Ratings said Vietnam is "tackling" its economic challenges. It also sees the economy as growing about 5 percent this year, compared with 2011\'s 5.89 percent. Vietnam\'s economy has been growing at a slower pace this year as the government shifted its policy to tightening lending in the early months of the year to help control inflation. Banks battling bad debt also slowed loans to keep their books clean, putting pressure on businesses seeking funds for expansion. In the first quarter, growth was 4 percent from a year earlier, and in the second quarter, the pace rose to 4.66 percent. "While demand in the economy has yet to become strong, there have been positive moves," the official Vietnam Economic Times newspaper cited Planning and Investment Ministry assessments as saying. President Truong Tan Sang told a business forum that\'s part of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Russia: "We are striving to stabilise the macro economy, maintaining reasonable growth and implementing a master plan to restructure the economy." In its report, Fitch said Vietnam "is tackling the challenges of greater inflation pressures, a fragile balance of payments position and a weak banking sector with greater vigor." It noted that Vietnam\'s foreign exchange reserves increased to $20.8 billion at the end of May from $14.1 billion in December 2011. August\'s inflation slowed to an annual rate of 5.04 percent, the lowest since December 2009, the government said. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 BANKING SECTOR CONCERNS Fitch said the banking sector "remains a large source of risk given the rising non-performing loan ra',

       'content': 'By Ben Klayman DETROIT (Reuters) - The deteriorating European markets have led auto industry executives to worry about possible contagion spreading across the Atlantic, but June new-car sales in the United States are expected to hit a five-year peak for that particular month. Auto sales, which offer an early snapshot of consumer demand, have been one of the bright spots in the U.S. economy for several months until May results came in short of expectations and raised concerns about the sector\'s recovery. Analysts and industry officials, however, said there are just too many old cars that need to be replaced, which will drive consumers into dealers\' showrooms. The average age of cars on the road is an all-time-high 11 years. "The most interesting thing is the ongoing battle between pent-up demand and concern over financial issues," said Karl Brauer, chief executive of research firm Total Car Score. "There is, by no means, clear sailing ahead on the financial issues, but people are getting really tired of driving their old cars." Economists polled by Thomson Reuters see the annual selling rate for new cars in the U.S. market in June finishing at 13.9 million vehicles. That would mark the second month in a row below the 14 million rate, but would exceed last month\'s 13.7 million. Opinions vary, however, as TrueCar.com expects a sales rate of 13.6 million, while General Motors Co (GM.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) CEO Dan Akerson said on Thursday the market was "surprisingly strong" and he saw it finishing between 14 million and 14.2 million. J.D. Power and LMC Automotive, and Edmunds.com see sales rising 20 percent from last year to about 1.27 million new cars and trucks, while TrueCar sees an increase of 18 percent. That would be the highest level since 1.46 million were sold in 2007, just before the U.S. economy slipped into a recession that forced GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy. Some of the projected increase will be due to a recovery by Toyota Motor Corp ',

       'content': 'By Genevra Pittman NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The United States foreign aid program that sends billions of dollars to African countries for HIV treatment and prevention has cut the number of people dying for any reason in those nations, a new study suggests. Researchers had previously shown that the initiative -- the U.S. President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR -- had prevented deaths from AIDS. But it was unclear if more people in those countries were only dying of tuberculosis or malaria instead, researchers explained. According to the new findings, about 741,000 deaths were averted in 2004 through 2008 in the 12 African countries with PEPFAR programs, such as Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda. "There were concerns that there\'s been this shift in physicians and nurses (toward HIV clinics) to the detriment of other public health concerns," said lead researcher Dr. Eran Bendavid, an infectious diseases specialist from Stanford University in California. But, he said, "We can\'t find evidence of unintended harms -- or benefits. More or less we find that PEPFAR seems to have been very effective at reducing deaths, probably mostly HIV-specific deaths." There\'s still some question as to whether or not the billions of dollars the U.S. puts toward the program has been worth those benefits, however. PEPFAR, created by President George W. Bush in 2003, promotes HIV prevention, screening and modern treatment by building local health care facilities, training workers and making sure countries have reliable ways to get AIDS drugs. Non-governmental organizations and universities do the work with U.S. grants and incentives. Data for the new study came from surveys done with adult women in 27 African countries, including nine with PEPFAR programs. Women were asked about their adult siblings and recent deaths in their families. The researchers used that information to calculate approximately how many adults in each country were dying every year, for any reason. In 2003, Bend',

Corruption is widely seen as holding back the economy and Yudhoyono has been criticised for letting the fight against it slow as he comes towards the end of his second five-year term. A series of corruption scandals have rocked the president\'s Democrat Party, weakening it in advance of elections in 2014 when Yudhoyono will step down. "The drum of war on corruption should not dissipate. Corruption should be completely eradicated," Yudhoyono said in a speech to parliament ahead of the country\'s Independence Day anniversary. "I have to admit there are still many perpetrators of corruption even in the government, parliament, regional representatives and among law enforcers," Yudhoyono said. Despite rampant graft, resource-rich Indonesia has become a favourite of emerging market investors because of its large domestic market as the world\'s fourth most populous country, rising middle class, relatively stable fiscal framework and low levels of public debt. Economic growth picked up to a stronger-than-expected 6.4 percent last quarter, defying a global downturn because of domestic consumption and investment. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Yudhoyono\'s wide-ranging speech ahead of Independence Day was the latest in a series to touch on corruption.

The main market index, which has been hovering around a 59-week high hit last week, has gained 19 percent so far this year, after shedding 17 percent in 2011. It has also outperformed its emerging market peers, which gained on average just under 7 percent. "Our target for (holdings of) stocks this year is around 60 percent and 40 percent in bonds," Mayowa Ogunwemimo, head of Nigerian asset management firm FSDH, which manages 50 billion naira, told Reuters. She had 40 percent in stocks last year. Pension funds and asset managers are targeting an index level of 26,000 points by year-end on sub-Saharan Africa\'s second biggest stock market, which opened at 20,672 points in January, as bond yields fall and the naira stabilises. The naira has over the last month firmed to around 157-158 to the dollar, a three-and-half-month high, driven by buoyant oil prices and by foreign investors buying up Nigerian assets. Nigeria\'s foreign exchange reserves jumped to a 29-month high of $41.16 billion by Sept. 10. "Yields on bonds have fallen in the last few weeks because of liquidity from foreign investors, making stocks more attractive," Ogunwemimo said. Bond yields, which were at 2-year high last month, have started to fall, shedding 300 basis points on the 10- and 20-year notes, after JP Morgan said it will add Nigerian debt to its emerging government bond index from October. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 REAL RALLY?

       'content': 'LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - New French President Francois Hollande said on the night of his election that he wanted to be judged only on his pledges to fairness and youth.  On the second promise at least, Hollande, who took office on Tuesday, and other Western leaders have their work cut out: More than one in five young people in France are out of work, as they are in Britain, Italy, Ireland, Poland and Sweden.  "Governments need to address this economic and social problem with decisive and concrete action," Angel Gurr\xc3\xada, secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said in a statement.  In the 34-country OECD area, youth unemployment is at 17.1 percent - more than twice as high as the overall jobless rate. In Spain and Greece, where every second youth is out of work, the rate is three times higher.  Figures released on Tuesday by the OECD ahead of a meeting of G20 labour ministers in Mexico this week highlight the rapid deterioration in the job market for 15- to 24-year-olds.  In Spain, unemployment in this age group has jumped to 51.1 percent from 17.4 percent in March 2007.  The global financial crisis is the main reason for the spike in unemployment, but a mismatch of skills due to technological change and globalisation is making it worse.  Many jobs that required only a secondary education have moved offshore, while the ones that are replacing them demand increasingly sophisticated qualifications.  This structural change explains why the United States has 1.2 million unemployed workers but 3.6 million unfilled jobs, according to a new report by the Henry Jackson Initiative (HJI), a business group whose aim is to make the case for capitalism.  A survey last year by Manpower, a recruitment agency, found 52 percent of U.S. employers were facing big difficulties in filling vacancies due to a skills shortage, the report noted.  Recent trends in education were exacerbating the mismatch, the HJI study argued. University degrees had become prized at the expense of vocational education; Germany, with a comprehensive education system, was a notable exception.  Germany\'s youth jobless rate in March was 7.9 percent, compared with 24.9 percent in the United States, three times more than the overall unemployment rate.  Raghuram Rajan, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, also took aim at "expensive degrees that have little value in the job market".  "More information on job prospects in various career tracks, along with better counselling about educational and training programmes, can help people make better decisions before they enroll in expensive but useless programmes," Rajan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago, wrote in the latest edition of Foreign Affairs.  In areas of high unemployment, Rajan recommended subsidies for firms to hire first-time young workers, a prescription echoed by the OECD.  The Paris-based forum said the subsidies - or, alternatively, reductions in social security contributions - should be targeted at low-skilled youth and those who have finished their apprenticeships as well as at smaller firms.

       'content': 'PARIS, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The Chinese city of Shanghai came top for mathematics, reading and science among teenagers in a study that suggested East Asian schools were driving academic excellence by tackling tough classrooms and abandoning rote-learning. Fifteen-year-olds in the United States trailed in maths and were average for reading and science in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\'s triennial student survey that assessed its 34 members and 31 mostly developing countries. With a special focus on mathematics, the latest Programme in International Student Assessment (PISA) tested the maths, reading and science knowledge of some 510,000 15-year-olds last year. Released on Tuesday, the study said schools in East Asian countries dominated the league table. With Shanghai at the top, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taipei, Korea, Macao and Japan also won high marks for mathematics, reading and science. Liechtenstein, Switzerland and the Netherlands also made it into the top 10 best performing education systems while Germany and Poland made significant progress. In maths, students in Shanghai had the equivalent of nearly three years of schooling above the OECD average. The recipe of East Asia\'s success is setting high standards for all schools and giving them the means to achieve them, the OECD\'s head of education Andreas Schleicher told Reuters. "They basically succeed in attracting the most talented teachers to the most challenging classrooms, they get really great principals in the tough schools," Schleicher said. "They mobilise resources where they can make the most differences," he added. In a new development, the OECD found that East Asian students were increasingly able to extrapolate from what they were taught and use their knowledge creatively - skills traditionally more associated with Western school systems. "Many Asian systems have been able to overcome the stereotypes of rote-learning," Schleicher said. TEACHER SALARIES PART OF THE ANSWER The PISA are closely watched by policymakers and parents around the world to see how their education system stacks up. Poor rankings matter as they can trigger the soul searching that leads to change. Germany\'s surprise, below-average showing in 2000 led to reforms that put it back among the best ranked. So what, according to the results, is the recipe for making a high-performing education system? Part of the answer appears to be paying teachers well. High-performing school systems tended to pay their teachers more compared to national per capita income, the OECD said. But that was only part of the answer as well-qualified teachers also had to be sent to disadvantaged schools to make a bigger difference. The best-performing school systems tended to share resources more equitably between advantaged and disadvantaged schools, suggesting it\'s not just how much a country spends on education as how well and fairly it spends it. Across OECD countries, students from wealthier backgrounds are about a year ahead of their less-advantaged peers. Early starters also performed better, with students who attended pre-primary school at about a year ahead of those who did not. The OECD recommended in particular that governments subsidise pre-primary education in poor areas. Schleicher said East Asian countries still had work to do on ensuring that talented students get top jobs, noting it remained difficult for women in those countries to break the glass ceiling despite being highly educated. Nonetheless, their top marks in education were setting the stage for strong economies, he said. "Your education is your economy tomorrow. Our economies increasingly depend on the talent so those countries are positioning themselves very well." (editing by Mark John and Elizabeth Piper)',

       'content': 'LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - South Sudan\'s chief negotiator on Tuesday criticised China, which backs both Juba and Khartoum, for not taking a more robust role in resolving a crisis between the neighbours that has halted oil output and may tip them back into war.  China is one of Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir\'s strongest supporters and has had to play a delicate balancing act with South Sudan, which seceded from the north in July and with which Beijing has major business and oil interests.  South Sudan gained independence in July under a 2005 settlement deal that ended two decades of civil war.  The Asian giant pledged $8 billion in development funds when South Sudanese President Salva Kiir visited Beijing last week.  China is the biggest buyer of South Sudan\'s oil and last year it imported 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from the two countries, according to the International Energy Agency.  Speaking at London think-tank Chatham House, negotiator Pagan Amum said China\'s balancing act was too cautious.  "Honestly speaking, China has not succeeded. They appointed a special envoy who came very late and also who was very cautious," Amum said.  "By trying to move away from Khartoum so as to get closer to South Sudan and trying not to get too close to South Sudan so as not to cause displeasure to Khartoum ... neither Khartoum nor Juba will be happy with China," he said.  At the same time, China, traditionally seen as Bashir\'s ally at the Security Council, is resisting Western moves at the United Nationls that would threaten both sides with sanctions if they fail to halt the conflict.  "We would want to see China playing a more active role. Their role has not been very active. Maybe China also (needs) to catch up its foreign policy with its international position, having huge investments abroad," Amum said.  "They definitely need to be more proactive, especially in relation to Sudan and South Sudan," he said.  The two countries have been arguing over oil transit fees, border demarcation, and citizenship. Last month the dispute broke out into cross-border fighting along the 1,800 km (1,100 mile) badly demarcated border.  South Sudan shut down its production of crude oil, over what it said was the illegal seizure of the oil by Sudan. Sudan says it seized the oil to make up for unpaid fees.  Amum repeated previous statements that Juba would no longer consider sending its oil through Sudan because of the seizures, saying such an option is, "out of negotiations".  When landlocked South Sudan seceded from Sudan last year, it took three-quarters of the region\'s crude production, while the pipelines to export the oil are mostly in Sudan.  Juba is considering building a pipeline through Kenya to a port there to bypass the north, and has asked China to consider joining the project.  "As long as this is the mindset in Khartoum, the easiest way to export our oil is through an alternative pipeline," Amum said on Tuesday. "It is clear to the Chinese as well."  Analysts have expressed skepticism about the viability of a new pipeline, given security concerns and the dwindling amount of South Sudanese oil it could carry.  According to BP\'s 2011 energy statistical review, Sudan had proved reserves of 6.7 billion barrels at the end of 2010, with a daily production of 486,000 bpd.

       'content': '* Delicate diplomacy as Obama prepares to change security team * Disputes between allies Seoul and Tokyo awkward for U.S. * Hawkish Japan politicians complicate alliance management By Paul Eckert WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The United States sent its top Asian diplomacy and security officials to South Korea and Japan to calm tensions between two U.S. allies whose squabbling has frustrated efforts to deal with a troublesome North Korea and an increasingly assertive China. The high-powered delegation from the White House, Pentagon and State Department departed on Monday and will be visiting the region shortly after the election of a new nationalist-leaning Japanese government in December and before Seoul inaugurates a new president in February. Washington hopes South Korea and Japan can put a lid on spats over history and territory stemming from Japan\'s 1910-45 occupation of Korea. U.S. officials also seek to reassure Tokyo as it confronts almost daily challenges from China over which has sovereignty of disputed islets in a separate, more dangerous, territorial row with Beijing. The long-simmering disputes erupted anew last year, plunging Tokyo\'s ties with Seoul and Beijing to troubling lows and casting a cloud over the President Barack Obama\'s signature policy for East Asia - rebalancing security forces in the region - in part to cope with a surging China. "We want to see the new Japanese government, the new South Korean government, all of the countries in Northeast Asia working together and solving any outstanding issues, whether they are territorial, whether they\'re historic, through dialogue," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said last week. Troubles between Asia\'s second and fourth biggest economies are frustrating to Washington at a time when a defiant North Korea has tested a long-range rocket and may be poised to conduct its third nuclear test. CLEARING TENSIONS FROM 2012 In one of the final acts before Obama brings in a new national security team for his second term, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, Assistant Secretary of Defense Mark Lippert and Daniel Russel, the National Security Council senior director for Asian affairs, will meet with officials in Seoul and Tokyo. U.S. officials regularly meet counterparts from the two countries, which have been American allies since the 1950s and together host most of the 80,000 U.S. troops in Asia. But the antagonistic nationalism that flared up in Asian capitals last year makes this trip anything but routine. The Japan-South Korea dispute intensified in August when President Lee Myung-bak became the first South Korean leader to set foot on islands claimed by both countries but controlled by Seoul. They are known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan. Lee\'s visit and his call for Emperor Akihito to go beyond earlier expressions of "deepest regrets" for Japan\'s colonial rule followed South Korea\'s last-minute cancellation of a bilateral agreement with Japan on sharing intelligence. The troubles between Seoul and Tokyo coincided with a standoff between Japan and China over another cluster of islets, known as the Diaoyu in China and the Senkaku in Japan. The dispute sparked violent anti-Japanese protests in China last summer that damaged Japanese businesses in China. Last year\'s protests have been followed by a consumer boycott and repeated incursions by Chinese boats and planes into seas and airspace around the islands, which are controlled by Japan. The ships and aircraft that have appeared to challenge Japanese control of those waters and force Tokyo to end its refusal to acknowledge that a territorial dispute exists have been Chinese government vessels. So far China has stopped short of sending military vessels into disputed areas. But analysts warn of the potential for miscalculation. Any Japan-China conflict could embroil the United States, which says that the islets are covered under the U.S.-Japan security treaty - even though Washington takes no position on the sovereignty dispute. ABE: NATIONALISM OR PRAGMATISM? Another understated aim of the U.S. mission to Tokyo this week is to convince Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to step away from some of the more nationalist policies of the platform on which he campaigned and won office on last month. Washington is particularly concerned about Abe\'s previous calls to revise or rescind a landmark 1995 apology for Japan\'s wartime aggression and 1993 statement acknowledging an official Japanese role in the recruiting of tens of thousands of mostly South Korean "comfort women" to serve troops during World War Two. Such actions would anger Asian nations that suffered from Japan\'s militarism, further complicating both U.S. attempts to manage ties between its allies in the region and relations with China, which also is ushering in new leadership in March. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last week that Abe would stand by the 1995 apology. Although Abe packed his Cabinet with politicians who hold extremely revisionist views of history, analysts are predicting policies will be pragmatic, with a focus on reviving the economy. "The Abe administration basically will not touch foreign diplomacy and security affairs before the Upper House election" in July, former Vice Minister for Defense Motohiro Oono of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan told a think tank panel in Washington last week. Bruce Klingner, an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said recent statements from Abe have been "suitably nuanced." He said during Abe\'s 2006-7 tenure as prime minister, he "defied many of the same predictions by maintaining and even improving Japan\'s relations with its neighbors." Abe\'s gestures to neighbors include sending an envoy to meet South Korean President-elect Park Geun-hye; announcing that his first overseas trip since winning office will be to Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand; and offering to supply the Philippines with 10 coast guard vessels and communications equipment to help Manila in its territorial dispute with China.

Scientists hope the particles will help unlock secrets of the solar system\'s formation.  The unmanned craft Hayabusa, meaning "falcon" in Japanese, was destroyed on re-entry in June, but managed to drop a container bearing the sample after landing on the near-Earth asteroid Itokawa in 2005.  Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) says the particles may offer clues about how the solar system was formed 4.6 billion years ago.  Asteroids are believed to have retained their original state over time, unlike the Earth\'s surface, which has been affected by atmospheric changes, water and volcanic activity.  "There is so much that humans don\'t know, such as how the Mo on was formed," a JAXA spokesman said. "But research, not just into these particles but into other findings, could provide us with hints on how the solar system and the planets were formed."  Part of the sample would be distributed next year to researchers around the world for further tests, JAXA said.  Most of the particles were smaller than one-100th of a millimeter and components included minerals such as olivine, pyroxene and plagioclases.  Scientists also hope the findings will shed light on the risk to Earth from asteroid impacts.',
